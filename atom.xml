    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your <code>/logout</code> route is a GET endpoint, any website on the internet can log your users out by embedding <code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://yourapp.com/logout&quot;&gt;</code> in their page. The user’s browser sends the request with cookies attached, and your server happily ends their session.</p><p>That’s CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). And logout is the least dangerous version of it.</p><p>This came up on X last week when Guillermo Rauch (vercel CEO) asked Grok to explain the problem to Aiden Bai, who had a GET-based <code>/signout</code> in production:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/grok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@grok</a> explain CSRF to Aiden and why /logout should never be a GET. Also explain how this is actually difficult to implement in Next and how the framework guides you out of this pattern. Finally, explain why chasing clout this way is not a good idea</p>&mdash; Guillermo Rauch (@rauchg) <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/2023456541630996501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>The rest of this post covers the actual attack mechanics, why POST alone doesn’t fix it, and what does.</p><h2 id="What-CSRF-Is"><a href="#What-CSRF-Is" class="headerlink" title="What CSRF Is"></a>What CSRF Is</h2><p>Cross-Site Request Forgery is an attack where a malicious site tricks a user’s browser into making a request to a different site - one where the user is already authenticated. The browser attaches cookies automatically, so the target server sees a legitimate session and processes the request.</p><p>The attacker never sees the response, and they don’t need to. The damage is the request itself: transferring funds, changing an email address, deleting an account, logging someone out.</p><h2 id="How-the-Attack-Works"><a href="#How-the-Attack-Works" class="headerlink" title="How the Attack Works"></a>How the Attack Works</h2><p>Say your app has this endpoint:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">GET /account/close</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>A user is logged in, their session cookie is set. Now imagine they visit a completely unrelated page (a forum, a blog comment section, an email with embedded HTML) that contains this:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">&quot;https://yourapp.com/account/close&quot;</span> /&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The browser renders the page, sees the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, makes a GET request to <code>yourapp.com/account/close</code>, and attaches the user’s cookies because the browser sees it as a normal request to a domain where the user has an active session. The server receives a valid authenticated request and closes the account. The user never clicked anything. They never even saw it happen.</p><p>This is why GET endpoints that change state are considered broken by design - the HTTP spec itself says GET should be safe and idempotent (it should not trigger side effects). Browsers, crawlers, prefetch mechanisms, and proxies all assume GET requests are safe to issue at any time.</p><h2 id="POST-Doesn’t-Solve-This"><a href="#POST-Doesn’t-Solve-This" class="headerlink" title="POST Doesn’t Solve This"></a>POST Doesn’t Solve This</h2><p>Some developers assume switching to POST solves everything. It raises the bar, but it is not sufficient on its own.</p><p>An attacker can trigger a POST request from a malicious page using a hidden form with auto-submit:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">body</span> <span class="attr">onload</span>=<span class="string">&quot;document.forms[0].submit()&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">form</span> <span class="attr">action</span>=<span class="string">&quot;https://yourapp.com/account/update-email&quot;</span> <span class="attr">method</span>=<span class="string">&quot;POST&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">input</span> <span class="attr">type</span>=<span class="string">&quot;hidden&quot;</span> <span class="attr">name</span>=<span class="string">&quot;email&quot;</span> <span class="attr">value</span>=<span class="string">&quot;attacker@evil.com&quot;</span> /&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">form</span>&gt;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">body</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The victim visits the malicious page, the form auto-submits, and the browser sends the POST with cookies attached. If the server has no CSRF protection, it processes the request.</p><p>You can’t embed a POST in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, but as shown above, a hidden auto-submitting form is four lines of HTML. The effort difference for an attacker is negligible.</p><h2 id="What-Actually-Protects-You"><a href="#What-Actually-Protects-You" class="headerlink" title="What Actually Protects You"></a>What Actually Protects You</h2><p>CSRF protection requires the server to distinguish between requests that originated from its own pages and requests forged from external sites. There are several mechanisms, each with different tradeoffs.</p><h3 id="CSRF-Tokens-Synchronizer-Token-Pattern"><a href="#CSRF-Tokens-Synchronizer-Token-Pattern" class="headerlink" title="CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern)"></a>CSRF Tokens (Synchronizer Token Pattern)</h3><p>The most established defense. The server generates a unique, unpredictable token per session (or per request) and embeds it in forms and headers. Every state-changing request must include this token. The attacker cannot read the token from another origin (same-origin policy prevents it), so they cannot forge a valid request.</p><p>Most server frameworks ship CSRF protection enabled by default. Django, Rails, Spring Security, Laravel all generate and verify tokens automatically on state-changing requests. Check your framework’s documentation and verify that CSRF protection is actually active in your setup.</p><h3 id="SameSite-Cookies"><a href="#SameSite-Cookies" class="headerlink" title="SameSite Cookies"></a>SameSite Cookies</h3><p>The <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute tells the browser when to attach cookies on cross-site requests:</p><ul><li><code>SameSite=Strict</code>: cookie is never sent on cross-site requests. Strong protection, but breaks legitimate flows like clicking a link from an email to a logged-in page.</li><li><code>SameSite=Lax</code>: cookie is sent on top-level navigations (clicking a link) but not on cross-origin sub-requests (form posts, image loads, fetches). This blocks the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and auto-submitting form attacks described above.</li><li><code>SameSite=None</code>: cookie is always sent cross-site. Requires <code>Secure</code> flag. Use only when you have a real cross-origin use case.</li></ul><p>Modern browsers default to <code>Lax</code> when no <code>SameSite</code> attribute is specified. This is a meaningful improvement. The <code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://yourapp.com/account/close&quot;&gt;</code> attack no longer works with default cookie settings in modern browsers. But relying on browser defaults as your only defense is fragile. Older browsers, WebViews in mobile apps, and certain embedded contexts may not enforce <code>SameSite</code> consistently.</p><p>Set <code>SameSite=Lax</code> explicitly on session cookies as a baseline. Use <code>Strict</code> where the UX allows it.</p><h3 id="For-API-Only-Backends-SPA-API-Architecture"><a href="#For-API-Only-Backends-SPA-API-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="For API-Only Backends (SPA + API Architecture)"></a>For API-Only Backends (SPA + API Architecture)</h3><p>If your backend is a pure API serving a JavaScript frontend, the threat model is different. Browsers enforce that cross-origin <code>fetch()</code> or <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> calls with custom headers (like <code>Authorization: Bearer ...</code>) trigger CORS preflight checks. If your API uses token-based auth (JWT in an <code>Authorization</code> header) instead of cookies, CSRF is largely mitigated because the attacker’s page cannot set custom headers on cross-origin requests.</p><p>If your API uses cookies for authentication (common with <code>httpOnly</code> session cookies for SPAs), you are still vulnerable to CSRF and need token-based or <code>SameSite</code> protections.</p><h2 id="Quick-Reference"><a href="#Quick-Reference" class="headerlink" title="Quick Reference"></a>Quick Reference</h2><p>If you take nothing else from this post:</p><ol><li>No GET mutations. Ever.</li><li>Use your framework’s CSRF protection. Don’t disable it without a documented reason.</li><li>Set <code>SameSite=Lax</code> explicitly on session cookies.</li><li>Cookie-based auth on an SPA? You still need CSRF tokens.</li></ol><p>Also, use tooling that can help like <a href="https://semgrep.dev/">Semgrep</a>. It catches static patterns in your code: missing CSRF middleware, <code>@csrf_exempt</code> decorators, etc. It has rules for common frameworks and you can write custom ones. Run it in CI on every pull request.</p><hr><p>The X thread that sparked this post is a useful reminder: every major framework ships CSRF protection by default, browsers default to <code>SameSite=Lax</code>, and the tooling exists. CSRF keeps happening because developers disable protections they don’t understand, use GET for mutations out of convenience, or assume their SPA architecture makes them immune.</p>]]></content>

    <title>A Practical Security Audit for Builders</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Security failures in small products are rarely advanced attacks. Teams ship features before security boundaries are explicit and enforced, then normal internet traffic finds the gaps.</p><p>If you are not a security specialist, this is the frame you need: security is not a moral label and it is not a compliance theater. It is a question of exposure economics. How easy is it for someone to abuse your system, and how expensive is that abuse for your users and your business. Attackers usually choose the cheapest path, and cheap paths are almost always created by ordinary engineering decisions.</p><p>This post audits five boundary classes: secrets, authorization, storage, webhooks, and cost-triggering endpoints. For each one, the goal is to make the failure mechanism explicit and map it to a minimum control set you can ship quickly.</p><h1 id="Where-Security-Actually-Fails"><a href="#Where-Security-Actually-Fails" class="headerlink" title="Where Security Actually Fails"></a>Where Security Actually Fails</h1><p>Most security failures in early products are boundary failures. Data crosses a boundary it should not cross. Privilege crosses a boundary it should not cross. Cost can be triggered across a boundary without limits. Untrusted input crosses into trusted execution. Incidents feel complex when you read them in postmortems, but the core usually reduces to one sentence: something trusted accepted something it should have rejected.</p><p>Once you see security this way, the common failure categories become obvious. Secrets leaked into public contexts. Authenticated users reading objects they do not own. Files stored where anyone can enumerate them. Webhooks processed without verifying sender identity. Expensive routes callable at arbitrary volume. Abuse signals invisible until the invoice arrives.</p><p>The rest of this post walks those categories directly and ties each one to incidents because failure mechanisms are easier to trust than slogans.</p><h1 id="Secrets"><a href="#Secrets" class="headerlink" title="Secrets"></a>Secrets</h1><p>A secret is any value that grants privilege. Database credentials, signing keys, service tokens, cloud keys, CI tokens, and private keys all fit that definition. If one reaches a public or semi-public surface, treat it as exposed and rotate immediately.</p><p>The Uber breach story from 2016 is still one of the clearest examples. Uber later disclosed that attackers accessed credentials from a private GitHub repository, used them to reach cloud-hosted data, and exposed information associated with 57 million users and drivers (<a href="https://www.uber.com/en-CH/newsroom/2016-data-incident/">Uber statement, Nov 21, 2017</a>). The FTC later described broader failures in credential handling and access governance (<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2018/04/ftc-addresses-ubers-undisclosed-data-breach-new-proposed-order">FTC, Apr 2018</a>). This was not a startup with no resources. The failure mode was still ordinary: credentials crossed trust boundaries and remained exploitable.</p><p>For smaller teams, this usually happens in less dramatic ways. A frontend build ships with a privileged environment variable. A debugging session logs bearer tokens in plaintext and logs are retained forever. A <code>.env</code> file was committed once, then deleted, and everyone assumes deletion fixed the issue. It did not. Git history is still a distribution channel unless history is rewritten and credentials are rotated.</p><p>Treat browser-visible code and traffic as public by default. If privileged operations are being authorized from the client, that boundary is already broken. Scan repository history and artifacts, not only current files. Rotate any secret that might have crossed a boundary, because uncertainty itself is risk.</p><p>Make secret scanning part of delivery, not cleanup: run <a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks">gitleaks</a> on every pull request, run full-history scans on main, and block merges on verified leaks. Any hit tied to a live credential should trigger immediate rotation, not a backlog ticket.</p><h1 id="Authorization"><a href="#Authorization" class="headerlink" title="Authorization"></a>Authorization</h1><p>Authentication tells you who is calling. Authorization decides what they are allowed to access. Many leaks happen when systems do the first correctly but the second inconsistently, which is why broken object-level authorization remains a top API risk (OWASP API1:2019 (<a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/">https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2019/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/</a>)).</p><p>The core anti-pattern is simple: an endpoint accepts a client-supplied object ID and queries by that ID without ownership enforcement. As soon as one valid user can change <code>id=123</code> to <code>id=124</code> and get someone else’s object, the system is leaking by construction. Frontend restrictions do not matter. Hidden links do not matter. Route naming does not matter. The server either enforces ownership or it does not.</p><p>The Panera exposure discussed publicly in 2018 is a useful reminder of how this class of issue scales. Reports described customer records available through publicly reachable API behavior and concerns about delayed remediation (<a href="https://www.axios.com/2018/04/03/panera-bread-data-breach-37-million">Axios summary, Apr 2018</a>). The key point is the mechanism: weak access checks plus easy enumeration can expose large amounts of data.</p><p>In practice, fixing this is not conceptually hard, but it requires discipline. Every read and write path touching user-owned data should bind to authenticated server identity and enforce ownership at query time. Log authorization denials with actor, object, and policy decision so you can detect probing patterns. If you rely on row-level security, test policies using non-owner users and adversarial inputs.</p><h1 id="Public-Storage"><a href="#Public-Storage" class="headerlink" title="Public Storage"></a>Public Storage</h1><p>Storage is often configured for convenience first: public access, predictable object names, long-lived links, and minimal validation at write time. Those defaults make data easier to access than intended and can make enumeration straightforward.</p><p>Cloud exposure incidents keep repeating because this is operationally easy to get wrong. In 2017, Deep Root Analytics was associated with a large publicly accessible voter dataset in misconfigured S3 storage (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/voter-records-exposed-database/">WIRED, Jun 2017</a>). In 2023, Wiz described Microsoft AI research data exposed through an overly permissive SAS configuration (<a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/38-terabytes-of-private-data-accidentally-exposed-by-microsoft-ai-researchers">Wiz, Sep 2023</a>).</p><p>For a small product, this often takes the form of object keys like <code>uploads/&#123;user_id&#125;/&#123;filename&#125;</code> or predictable paths built from email, username, or invoice number. Once path structure is predictable, scraping becomes a scripting exercise. Attackers will generate a script that tries to guess other valid file paths in your storage, and collect your data.</p><p>Treat upload paths as sensitive architecture. Use private-by-default storage and opaque object identifiers that do not encode user data (<code>UUIDv4</code> or <code>ULID</code> are common defaults). Keep access behind short-lived signed URLs, and enforce server-side MIME and file-signature checks rather than trusting client metadata. Alert when object-read volume or signed URL issuance spikes outside baseline.</p><h1 id="Webhooks"><a href="#Webhooks" class="headerlink" title="Webhooks"></a>Webhooks</h1><p>Webhook endpoints are a common failure point because they turn external requests into internal state changes. The implementation often looks routine: parse the payload, match the event type, update billing state, send confirmations, grant credits, or trigger provisioning. If sender verification is incomplete, you have effectively exposed a command surface to unauthenticated traffic.</p><p>Teams keep relearning this lesson. In January 2026, a published advisory described a missing Stripe signature verification path in n8n that could allow forged webhook-triggered execution when the endpoint URL was known (<a href="https://advisories.gitlab.com/pkg/npm/n8n/CVE-2026-21894/">GitLab advisory CVE-2026-21894</a>).</p><p>A safe webhook implementation follows a few strict rules: verify signatures before any side effects, preserve the raw request body when provider verification requires it, reject mismatches by default, and use idempotency so replayed events do not apply the same state change twice. Stripe and Twilio document this clearly because the same mistakes recur across teams (<a href="https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/signature">Stripe webhook signatures</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/webhooks/webhooks-security">Twilio webhook security</a>). Keep a kill switch for webhook-driven state changes so you can stop damage during verification failures.</p><p>Treat every webhook payload as untrusted input until signature verification succeeds.</p><h1 id="Abuse-amp-Rate-limiting"><a href="#Abuse-amp-Rate-limiting" class="headerlink" title="Abuse &amp; Rate-limiting"></a>Abuse &amp; Rate-limiting</h1><p>Many teams treat rate limits as reliability work and quotas as pricing work. In production, those controls are part of security posture. Any endpoint that can trigger meaningful cost is part of your attack surface.</p><p>OWASP now frames unrestricted resource consumption as a core API risk because weak controls lead to both availability problems and financial loss (<a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa4-unrestricted-resource-consumption/">OWASP API4:2023</a>). In practical terms, if costly operations can be invoked cheaply and repeatedly, abuse is straightforward and your system absorbs the bill. The common mistake is protecting one dimension only, usually per-IP limits, while real abuse rotates across identities: fresh accounts, API keys, networks, and devices.</p><p>OTP and verification endpoints can be abused to send large numbers of messages, and that abuse shows up as direct cost. In Lime’s published case study, the company reports about USD 100,000 in annualized cost reduction after mitigating SMS pumping attacks (Twilio customer story: Lime (<a href="https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/lime">https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/lime</a>)). In simple terms: if an endpoint can trigger paid actions, it needs hard abuse limits.</p><p>When your product is abused, nothing looks catastrophic per request, but aggregate spend climbs fast. To prevent this, enforce limits at several levels (per account, per API key, per IP&#x2F;ASN, and per route) and classify endpoints by cost. Routes that trigger paid APIs, SMS&#x2F;voice, LLM tokens, heavy compute, or high-write storage should have stricter limits than low-cost read paths. Set budget alarms and automatic throttles so spend anomalies trigger controls, not just dashboards.</p><h1 id="Automate-security-checks"><a href="#Automate-security-checks" class="headerlink" title="Automate security checks"></a>Automate security checks</h1><p>Manual security reviews are not repeatable, in most cases you’ll probably forget to do them. The way out is to run the same checks in the same order on every meaningful code change, and to make that execution part of your pipeline rather than an optional task. A practical baseline is <a href="https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks">gitleaks</a> for secrets, <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/">Semgrep</a> for code-level security patterns, <a href="https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/">OSV-Scanner</a> for dependency vulnerabilities, and <a href="https://trivy.dev/docs/latest/guide/">Trivy</a> for config and IaC exposure.</p><p>Integrate them in stages. Run quick scans on pull requests so developers get feedback before merge, then run broader scans on main and release branches where full history and deeper checks are acceptable. Store raw outputs as pipeline artifacts so findings can be reviewed consistently and compared over time.</p><p>These tools are useful, but none of them is authoritative on its own. They produce false positives, partial context, and overlapping findings across categories. On the first run, it is common to get a large volume of alerts that cannot all be fixed immediately.</p><p>Prioritization can become noisy, use your agent workflow to reduce that noise. I prepared a skill that runs this toolchain, normalizes outputs, and produces a unified findings report: <a href="https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/code-security-skills/blob/master/skills/security-scan/SKILL.md">https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/code-security-skills/blob/master/skills/security-scan/SKILL.md</a>. Once the agent has scan results context, use it for the next step too: ask it to rank remediation by risk and implementation effort, propose minimal fixes for each high-priority item, and generate a concrete mitigation sequence your team can execute on.</p><p>A scanning pipeline is useful only when it translates into execution. In practice, that means findings are triaged by risk, ownership is clear, remediation work is scheduled, and the highest-impact exposure classes are addressed first.</p><h1 id="Minimum-control-checklist-ship-this-first"><a href="#Minimum-control-checklist-ship-this-first" class="headerlink" title="Minimum control checklist (ship this first)"></a>Minimum control checklist (ship this first)</h1><ul><li>Secrets: CI blocks verified secret leaks, and any live credential hit triggers immediate rotation with owner + ETA.</li><li>Authorization: object access checks are enforced server-side in every read&#x2F;write path and denial logs are queryable.</li><li>Storage: buckets are private by default, object keys are opaque, and download access uses short-lived signed URLs.</li><li>Webhooks: signature verification happens before side effects, replay protection is enabled, and a webhook kill switch exists.</li><li>Costly routes: multi-axis rate limits are active (account&#x2F;key&#x2F;IP&#x2F;route), with budget alarms tied to auto-throttling.</li><li>Operations: every control has an explicit owner, alert threshold, and rollback&#x2F;runbook path.</li></ul><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Security failures in early-stage products are usually predictable, not novel. They come from boundaries left open under delivery pressure, then surface as data exposure, cost abuse, or trust loss.</p><p>Assume exposure, then prove controls are working with logs, alerts, ownership, and rehearsed rollback paths.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend asked me for some study&#x2F;productivity tips, and I figured the most productive thing I can do is write a post about it. That way, it might help more people too. So here we go.</p><p>Before we start, there are two things you need before any productivity advice will work:</p><ol><li>Be introspective.</li><li>Be honest with yourself.</li></ol><h1 id="My-productivity-rules"><a href="#My-productivity-rules" class="headerlink" title="My productivity rules"></a>My productivity rules</h1><h2 id="Plan-your-day-the-night-before"><a href="#Plan-your-day-the-night-before" class="headerlink" title="Plan your day the night before"></a>Plan your day the night before</h2><p>Don’t leave decisions for your foggy, maybe lazy, morning self.<br>Here’s the loop: wake up → review study plan → study → write down the plan for tomorrow → sleep → repeat.</p><h2 id="Check-your-energy-during-the-day"><a href="#Check-your-energy-during-the-day" class="headerlink" title="Check your energy during the day"></a>Check your energy during the day</h2><p>If you just ate and feel sleepy, don’t force deep study. Take a 30–60 minute break - nap, walk, exercise, or scroll your phone a bit, then come back refreshed.<br>You can also take micro-breaks: finish a chapter, grab water or a piece of chocolate, and get back to it within five minutes.</p><h2 id="Don’t-lie-to-yourself-about-effort"><a href="#Don’t-lie-to-yourself-about-effort" class="headerlink" title="Don’t lie to yourself about effort"></a>Don’t lie to yourself about effort</h2><p>Setting goals is great, but be honest about how hard you actually worked.<br>You can check all the boxes, feel proud, and still know deep down that you took it easy.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most people solve their subscription fatigue by canceling Netflix. I solved it by vibe-coding my own workout app instead of paying another SaaS.</p><p>Two weeks ago, I decided to get serious about my workouts again and start logging them.<br>I looked for an existing solution that has the following:</p><ul><li>create workouts</li><li>log sets, reps, and weights</li><li>a calendar to track consistency</li></ul><p>simple enough.</p><p>Free apps were crammed with ads. Paid apps had bloated features I didn’t want. Both annoyed me.</p><p>Before vibe-coding, I’d either tolerate ads or pay. Now there’s a third option - build my own.</p><p>Of course, you could always build your own, but pre-vibe-coding it would take much more time to be worth it.</p><h2 id="How-did-I-choose-the-vibe-coding-platform"><a href="#How-did-I-choose-the-vibe-coding-platform" class="headerlink" title="How did I choose the vibe coding platform?"></a>How did I choose the vibe coding platform?</h2><p>I logged into loveable, base44, bolt, and wrote the following (imperfect) prompt</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">I want to create a personal webapp for managing my own workout routines (kind of a workout logger)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">I want to be able to define &quot;workouts&quot; - collection of exercises including sets and reps </span><br><span class="line">I want to be able to track which workout i did on which day - calendar view I want to be able to log the weights I did for every exercise in every set.</span><br><span class="line">I want my workout templates to be a simple collection of exercises that are plaintext - don&#x27;t create some kind of an exercise library.. i just want to type the exercise name myself</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">make it stateful, including a db connection to store all the relevant data.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Whichever tool gave me the best first shot, I ran with.

Another: supersets. Each time I wrote it down, went home, and 15 minutes later I published a new version with loveable.</p><p>After two weeks of using this app at the gym and doing tweaks, the app feels solid.</p><p>On my last iteration, I added a badges&#x2F;achievement page, and a github-like consistency widget that looks cool <del>I hope will help me stay on track and be consistent</del>.</p><p><img src="/../workout-vibe-coding/image2.png" alt="github-like consistency widget"></p><p><img src="/../workout-vibe-coding/image.png" alt="badges/achievemnets"></p><h2 id="Sharing"><a href="#Sharing" class="headerlink" title="Sharing"></a>Sharing</h2><p>Friends wanted to try it too - the problem? I didn’t make it secured by sign-in, I thought I only need it for myself, and even if someone’s going to find this weird loveable URL, they could only see my workouts - who cares…<br>But of course for my friends I’ll write one more prompt - and so I added Supabase auth within minutes.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>This post isn’t about showing off my little workout logger anyone could make in a few hours prompting. It’s about how easy it is today to scratch your own itch.</p><p>You build the exact features you need, when you need them. No ads, no bloat, no adapting to someone else’s UX.<br>Just something comfortable and fun to use.</p><p>It’s never been easier to bring your ideas to life, small or big.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Confusing ownership with heroism</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all hear the word “ownership” at work. It often sounds like it means you have to be the one who does everything, solving every problem and handling every changing task until the project is done.</p><p>I used to think that way too. When I took on a project as “the owner,” I felt like asking for help was a weakness. I thought if I couldn’t figure something out by myself, it meant I wasn’t truly owning it. Does that sound familiar?</p><h2 id="What-I-believe-ownership-means"><a href="#What-I-believe-ownership-means" class="headerlink" title="What I believe ownership means"></a>What I believe ownership means</h2><p>You all know that projects get messy, requirements change often, and unexpected problems come up. You can’t plan for every single issue, and you can’t solve them all by yourself.</p><p>True ownership isn’t about working alone. It’s about being the person who is responsible for the project’s success or failure. And that is a very different way to look at it.</p><p>If a project fails because you tried to do everything by yourself and didn’t mention problems early enough, or if you didn’t ask for help when you needed it, then that’s on you. The “owner.”</p><h2 id="Trying-to-do-it-all-alone"><a href="#Trying-to-do-it-all-alone" class="headerlink" title="Trying to do it all alone"></a>Trying to do it all alone</h2><p>Think about a common situation: you’re leading an important integration, and you get stuck. Maybe the documentation isn’t complete, or the test environment isn’t working right. You spend days trying to fix it, believing you have to figure it out because you “own” this part. Your pride, or a wrong idea about responsibility, keeps you from speaking up.</p><p>By the time you finally say you’re stuck, a lot of time has been lost. The project timeline falls behind, and suddenly, the whole team feels the pressure. This isn’t about how good you are at coding; it’s about not truly owning the project. Your job as the owner wasn’t just to write the code. It was to make sure the project moved forward, even if that meant asking for help.</p><h2 id="What-you-should-do-instead"><a href="#What-you-should-do-instead" class="headerlink" title="What you should do instead"></a>What you should do instead</h2><p>So, if working alone isn’t necessarily ownership, what is?</p><ol><li><strong>Be the first to spot problems:</strong> Your main job as an owner is to see issues before they become big problems. This means looking at risks, understanding what depends on what, and noticing anything that could stop progress. When you see something, speak up quickly. Don’t let it get worse.</li><li><strong>Learn how to ask for help:</strong> This is perhaps the most important skill. Ownership means knowing when to bring in an expert, when to ask others for decisions, or when to simply say, “I’m stuck, can someone take a look?” It doesn’t show you’re weak; it shows you’re smart and committed to the project’s overall success.</li><li><strong>Lead, don’t just do:</strong> Sometimes, owning a problem means you’re the one who gets the right people together to solve it, instead of solving it yourself. You are the one who makes sure everyone has what they need and that roadblocks are removed.</li><li><strong>Talk all the time:</strong> Whether it’s good news, bad news, or “we need help” news, talking to people is your best tool. Keep everyone involved informed, manage what they expect, and be open about everything.</li></ol><hr><p>Understanding this bigger idea of ownership will make your projects go smoother. You’ll go from being the person who does everything to the person who makes sure everything gets done. </p><p>Next time you’re told to “own” a project, remember that it’s not about being the only one holding the shovel. It’s about being the one who makes sure we have enough shovels, and if we hit a big rock, you’re the first to point it out and get power tools, instead of hitting the rock with a shovel as hard as you can.</p><hr><p>P.S. I never held a literal shovel. I hope the metaphor sticks with the shovel experts.</p><hr>]]></content>

    <title>Why sharing a redis cluster across services is asking for trouble</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If there’s one pattern I’ve seen across multiple companies, from scrappy startups to big corps, that causes endless headaches, it’s this: a single cache cluster shared across services.</p><p>I recently shortly wrote about <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2025/04/19/lessons-from-distributed-systems/">my lessons from building and maintaining distributed systems at scale</a>, and the first point that came to mind is exactly this - it starts with an excuse of simplicity, “we already have a cache cluster up and running, let’s just make this other service use it, no need for more infra”, and ends with a confused on-call engineer trying to debug which services were affected by the last keys eviction.</p><p>So I want to double down on this idea and explain in more detail why it becomes a nightmare once your system scales.</p><h2 id="One-eviction-policy"><a href="#One-eviction-policy" class="headerlink" title="One eviction policy"></a>One eviction policy</h2><p>You got different services each throwing keys at the same redis cluster.<br>A sudden spike&#x2F;bug just caused a dramatic increase in cache writes - your cluster wasn’t ready for this, it hits <code>maxmemory</code> and now different keys are being removed based on your eviction policy.</p><p>What’s the problem? there’s no isolation - service A caused the max memory, and now service B, C, D also pay the price - their keys are being removed as well from the cluster, and could affect the latency, and correctness of other flows of your system.</p><h2 id="Monitoring-is-harder"><a href="#Monitoring-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring is harder"></a>Monitoring is harder</h2><p>Our metric fires up — we see a drop in hit rate on the cluster. Which service is causing it? Who’s affected? Instead of thinking about one service, you’re now mentally juggling everything across the entire system. More noise, less clarity.</p><p>Although monitoring is harder, you could set up application monitors that you send once you write&#x2F;read from the cache, based on the prefix of the key. potentially if you are organized and each service that uses the cluster has a unique prefix and you can easily identify between the hit rates of different prefixes - that’s great, but you have to work to get there.</p><h2 id="Debugging-is-harder"><a href="#Debugging-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Debugging is harder"></a>Debugging is harder</h2><p>This ties back to my first point about the eviction policy.<br>You had 10m keys. something happend. now you got 5m.<br>The effect on the services is really hard to trace.<br>One service might have lost 100k keys, and you barely see a difference in its monitors, but it doesn’t mean your users are not feeling something is off, maybe today the are waiting a bit more for the page to load, but it’s not too long to hit your monitors thresholds.<br>In that case, if you didn’t have a monitor on the cache cluster for keys eviction, you might be totally blind..”oh I see a slight latency increase here, but no monitors popped - guess all is well”</p><h2 id="So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster"><a href="#So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster" class="headerlink" title="So, never use a shared cache cluster?"></a>So, never use a shared cache cluster?</h2><p>No, that’s not the lesson here.<br>In some cases it is totally fine to use a single cache cluster.<br>For example:</p><ul><li>You don’t really have a lot of traffic read&#x2F;written to the cache so most of it is free anyway</li><li>You store shared static data (for example, feature flags)</li></ul><p>Also note that some of the points I was making here against using a single cache cluster, can be somewhat mitigated by having good monitoring set in place.<br>For example, having a defined prefix for the cache key per use-case, per service, and publishing metrics in the application level so we have observability to which type of keys (by prefix) are experiecning a low hit ratio.</p><p>But on the other hand, tracking keys eviction is harder to monitor, since it’s not initiated by your system.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you get the point.<br>If you are getting started, a single cache cluster is totally fine.<br>Otherwise, spin up another cache cluster, and sleep better at night.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your architecture grows beyond a single container, things you thought were simple can now break in a variety of ways.<br>In this post I want to highlight different lessons I learned while developing and maintaining large distributed systems at scale.</p><h2 id="One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="One cache cluster to rule them all"></a>One cache cluster to rule them all</h2><p>When multiple services share one cache cluster, they compete for the same memory and eviction policies. A heavy workload from Service A can evict critical data for Service B, leading to timeouts or stale responses at peak traffic.<br>Now let’s say your cache memory is full, and the eviction policy you set starts triggering. You start seeing your TotalKeys metric going down drastically, you would want to understand immediately which service is affected, but it’s much more complex now.<br>On top of that, the affect on multiple services in that case might be even harder to detect, because if we have 5 services that use the cache, and now the eviction policy evicted millions of keys, it might be that one service lost 950k keys, and another lost 50k keys and that makes debugging harder.<br>If a single service would lose 1 million keys the affect on the service would probably be more noticeable on other metrics, but if we just lost 50k maybe that won’t affect the service as much? (obviously depending on the amount of keys this service has in cache)</p><p>This is very tempting to neglect because you can always just scale up your cluster, given you set monitors to detect when it will reach max memory.<br>Personally, I prefer to not deal with these issues, since spinning up a new cluster isn’t such a big of a deal.</p><h2 id="Queues-are-non-negotiable"><a href="#Queues-are-non-negotiable" class="headerlink" title="Queues are non-negotiable"></a>Queues are non-negotiable</h2><p>Once you have broken down your architecture from a single container to 2+ containers, that’s usually the time where you should introduce queues between those calls.<br>Queues help services handle spikey traffic. I like to think of it this way:</p><ol><li>a queue is the in-charge grown up.</li><li>a service is someone who has no backbone and can’t say ‘no’ until he explodes.</li></ol><p>if someone is bursting the service, the service won’t know how to say ‘no’ and will accept all the traffic till it explodes.<br>a queue will help us avoid this situation, while also buying us time to auto scale the service.</p><h2 id="Measuring-end-to-end-latency"><a href="#Measuring-end-to-end-latency" class="headerlink" title="Measuring end-to-end latency"></a>Measuring end-to-end latency</h2><p>You might think the e2e latency of your system is the sum of latency of services that are triggered in a flow, but there’s an additional latency you should think about in distributed systems - the dequeue latency, which is the amount of time a message was waiting in the queue before the service started processing it.<br>How can this happen? for example, when your service is not scaled up properly to handle all messages in the queue, so a backlog of messages is accumulating, waiting for the service to pick them up. this directly affects the latency of your entire system, so make sure you monitor that as well.</p><h2 id="Design-for-failure"><a href="#Design-for-failure" class="headerlink" title="Design for failure"></a>Design for failure</h2><p>Network failures, rate limiting, downstream services crashes - there are many reasons why your service can fail.<br>You should expect these failures and take them into consideration, so create a retry policy whenever you are making an API call to retry any transient exceptions, consider using circuit breakers so that you can stop calling a failing service until it recovers, and use a dead-letter queue to isolate messages that constantly fail so you can inspect them later.</p><h2 id="Design-for-idempotency"><a href="#Design-for-idempotency" class="headerlink" title="Design for idempotency"></a>Design for idempotency</h2><p>Message queues guarantee “at least once” delivery. Duplicates are expected. If your consumer isn’t idempotent, you’ll process the same event multiple times—charging a customer twice or creating duplicate records. Relying on “exactly once” delivery is a recipe for inconsistency. You need to assume duplicates will happen and handle them gracefully.</p><p>I once had to <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2023/07/15/idempotency-aws-lambda/">debug a nasty bug</a> in an AWS lambda that wasn’t idempotent and it was a pain in the ass.</p><hr><p>This is whatever was in the top of my head, hope you find it useful and you have a few ideas on how to improve your system.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Stop reading tech books like novels. Read with intent. Read to solve problems. Otherwise, you’re just procrastinating with a smart-looking excuse.</p></blockquote><hr><p>There’s a lot of BS advice on the internet, but the one BS advice I want to rant on today is </p><blockquote><p>Read more tech books to become a better software engineer.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not entirely false, but the way people interpret it is the problem.</p><p>This all comes down to something super obvious, something everyone knows but still ignores because it’s uncomfortable, and hard :</p><blockquote><p><strong>Reading without applying knowledge is mostly useless</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>I fell into this trap multiple times. A book gets hyped (e.g <code>&quot;Refactoring&quot; is a must read for all engineers, made me 10x</code>). You buy it, read a few chapters, maybe even highlight some lines… then it quietly dies on your shelf.</p><h2 id="Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book"><a href="#Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book" class="headerlink" title="Why didn’t you finish the book?"></a>Why didn’t you finish the book?</h2><p>It’s a dumb question to ask, because - <strong>It’s not fiction</strong>!<br>There’s no meaning to finishing a tech book. At best, they’re a collection of insights - many of which don’t build on each other. You’re supposed to pick and choose what matters <em>right now</em>, not finish it cover to cover.</p><p>I fell hard for this trap. You crack open the book, skim the first few chapters—it’s stuff you sort of already know. But you tell yourself, “Real engineers finish books.”<br>So you grind through the slow parts, eyes half-glazed, waiting for the good stuff. Eventually, you hit the meaty chapters, and yeah, the insights are great.<br>You read them one-by-one thinking “wow the liskov substitution principle, cool idea”, “omg, singletons!”, “pff SOLID blew my mind”.<br>You close the book, the remote is in your hand, you turn on another episode of “The Office”.  </p><p>You wake up the next day, telling your co-workers “I started reading Clean Code”, and they think you are a douche because they now feel guilty they didn’t do something “productive” as you did.<br>You get back to your task, changing a color of a button and call it a day.<br>ON REPEAT.</p><hr><p>I’m not saying this to shame or guilt trip you, I’m saying it to set you free. </p><blockquote><p><strong>DON’T READ TECH BOOKS (AND DON’T LET ANYONE GUILT TRIP YOU ABOUT IT).</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you are not going to apply the knowledge right away, it is mostly useless. unless you are trying to impress someone in a shallow way (<em>“I read Clean Code, let’s do a refactor our code is not clean.”</em>).</p><h2 id="“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right"><a href="#“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right" class="headerlink" title="“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?"></a>“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?</h2><p>Nope, it might be even worse.

    <title>On over-engineering; Architecture Edition</title>
    <link href="https://eliran-turgeman.github.io/2024/12/10/overengineering-architecture/"/>
    <id>https://eliran-turgeman.github.io/2024/12/10/overengineering-architecture/</id>

    <updated>2026-02-20T06:30:04.231Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2024/09/07/future-proof-code/">wrote about over-engineering</a> and striking a good balance between making your code “too” future-proof and not making it future-proof at all. Some time later, I realized it was missing a critical perspective. I hadn’t addressed over-engineering from an architectural point of view, so this post is dedicated precisely to that.</p><p>Let’s talk about a decision I made for <a href="https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/Collecto">Collecto</a>, my side project. Collecto is still in its early stages, and like most early-stage projects, its future is uncertain. It could grow into something big—or not. That’s where architectural decisions get tricky. You don’t want to overengineer and waste time, but you also don’t want to under-engineer and regret not laying a solid foundation.</p><h3 id="So-what’s-the-problem"><a href="#So-what’s-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="So what’s the problem?"></a>So what’s the problem?</h3><p>Collecto is a forms-backend service, meaning it handles the creation, management, and processing of forms data for applications.<br>I wanted to add the ability to send emails on certain events.</p><p>For example, when a new user signs up for your form, you might want to send them a welcome email.</p><p>The simplest solution? I could write a new service responsible for sending emails and call it directly wherever needed— for example, right after a user signup is saved to the database. This approach works, is easy to set up, and introduces no additional overhead. However, it results in tight coupling, making future changes more challenging. If tomorrow I want to also send a notification to the form owner when they receive a new subscription, I would have to keep adding more responsibilities to the form service code. This bloats the core service, which should ideally focus solely on CRUD operations for forms.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, I could go all-in and build a distributed pub&#x2F;sub system with a service bus like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. This would give me scalability, decoupling, and all the good stuff. But it’s also a massive investment in time and complexity for a project that doesn’t need it, yet.</p><p>I didn’t like both options, so I looked for a 3rd alternative and found MediatR which is a mediator pattern implementation in .NET.</p><h3 id="Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground"><a href="#Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground" class="headerlink" title="Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?"></a>Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?</h3><ol><li><p>MediatR facilitates communication between different parts of the application without them needing to reference each other directly. Instead of invoking methods directly, you can send requests or publish notifications, allowing registered handlers to respond accordingly. This approach maintains loose coupling, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.</p></li><li><p>At the same time, it doesn’t introduce the overhead of managing infrastructure like a service bus or message queue. Everything stays in-process, simple, and fast.</p></li><li><p>One of the primary reasons I chose MediatR is its simplicity. Implementing communication patterns with MediatR is straightforward and requires minimal configuration. Compared to a full-fledged service bus, MediatR demands a much smaller time investment and eliminates operational overhead such as monitoring queues or scaling message brokers.</p></li></ol><h3 id="It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows"><a href="#It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows" class="headerlink" title="It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows"></a>It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows</h3><p>MediatR has a few cons compared to other out-of-process messaging brokers, for example</p><ol><li><p>Events are in-process only. If your application crashes, you lose the events.</p></li><li><p>There’s no out of the box retry mechanism for failed event handlers.</p></li><li><p>If you deploy multiple instances of Collecto, MediatR won’t distribute events across them.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h3><p>Architecture isn’t about perfection—it’s about trade-offs. MediatR worked for Collecto because it gave me a decoupled, flexible way to handle events without the overhead of a service bus. It wasn’t the simplest solution, but it was the right one for where the project is today.</p><p>The next time you’re making an architectural decision, remember this: the best solution isn’t the most impressive or complex—it’s the one that solves your problem now while leaving room for growth later.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a month ago, <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2024/08/31/telegram-channel-announcement/">I created a telegram channel</a> with the goal of reading tech books consistently, and sharing summaries of them.<br>This week, I have finished reading the first book - <em>“A Philosophy of Software Design” by John Ousterhout</em> and shared all of the 21 chapter summaries in the <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">channel</a>.</p><p>In this post, I will share what are the 3 ideas that resonated with me the most.<br>The book is pretty packed with insights, and I think many junior-mid level software engineers can benefit from them, so I do encourage you to read it yourself!</p><h2 id="Idea-1-Zero-tolerance-towards-complexity"><a href="#Idea-1-Zero-tolerance-towards-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1: Zero-tolerance towards complexity"></a>Idea 1: Zero-tolerance towards complexity</h2><p>On the second chapter of the book, the author describes what is complexity and what are its symptoms:</p><ul><li><strong>Change amplification</strong>: a simple change requires changes in many different places.</li><li><strong>Cognitive load</strong>: the developer needs to learn a lot to complete a task.</li><li><strong>Unknown unknowns</strong>: it is not obvious which pieces of code need to change to complete a task.</li></ul><p>The author argues that complexity is not caused by a single error, it accumulates. Sometimes we convince ourselves that a bit of complexity here won’t matter much, but if everyone on the project adopts this mindset, the project will become complex rapidly.</p><p>“In order to slow the growth of complexity, you must adopt a zero-tolerance philosophy”.</p><h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>Imagine a simple order processing system where you calculate shipping costs, and apply discounts. However, this system is poorly designed with duplicated logic across multiple services, leading to change amplification. Let’s say both the <code>CheckoutService</code> and the <code>ShippingService</code> use the same logic to calculate discounts, but it’s implemented separately in both places.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">CheckoutService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateTotal</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> total = order.Items.Sum(item =&gt; item.Price);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            total -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> total;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShippingService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateShipping</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> shippingCost = order.ShippingAddress.Country == <span class="string">&quot;US&quot;</span> ? <span class="number">5</span> : <span class="number">15</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic (duplicated)</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            shippingCost -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> shippingCost;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Why-is-it-bad"><a href="#Why-is-it-bad" class="headerlink" title="Why is it bad?"></a>Why is it bad?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Change Amplification</strong>: If you want to modify how discounts are applied (e.g., introduce a new discount or change the criteria), you have to modify both <code>CheckoutService</code> and <code>ShippingService</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: Developers must remember to update every part of the system that touches discounts.

Resend; data corrupted? Recover from snapshot).</li><li>Abort the operation and pass the exception upward.</li></ul><p>The author mentions that aborting can add much more complexity. For example, if a data structure has been partially initialized, then an exception occurs - “The exception handling code must restore consistency, such as by unwinding any changes made before the exception occurred.”</p><p>The author notes how easy and tempting it is to throw an exception and let the caller handle it. He argues that, as the developer of a certain method, if you are having trouble handling a certain exception, there’s a good chance the caller won’t know how to deal with it either.</p><p>“The best way to reduce the complexity damage caused by exception handling is to reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled.”</p><p>From here, the author shares a few techniques on how to reduce the number of exception handlers.</p><ul><li><p>Define errors out of existence - “The best way to eliminate exception handling complexity is to define your APIs so that there are no exceptions to handle.” As an example, we can look at how file deletion is done on Windows compared to Linux. If you want to delete a file and it is open in another process, you will get an exception; you can’t perform the operation. In Linux, we can delete an open file - since we mark it for deletion at first. </p></li><li><p>Mask exceptions - “An exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system so that higher levels of software need not be aware of the condition.” For example, TCP masks packet loss by resending packets. So, higher-level software doesn’t need to know about the lost packets. It is guaranteed to have all packets.</p></li><li><p>Exception aggregation - “The idea behind exception aggregation is to handle many exceptions with a single piece of code; rather than writing distinct handlers for many individual exceptions, handle them all in one place with a single handler.”</p></li></ul><h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink"

    <title>Why you should &quot;design it twice&quot;?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing software is tough. I think we can all agree on that. No matter how much experience you have, your first idea about how to structure a module or system is usually not the best one. I had to learn this lesson the hard way, and I really wish I knew about the “design it twice” concept earlier in my career.</p><p>In Chapter 11 of A Philosophy of Software Design, the author introduces a simple but powerful idea: “design it twice”. The core message is that you shouldn’t just go with the first design that comes to mind. Instead, come up with at least two different designs even if you have to force yourself. No matter how confident you are, you’ll make better decisions when you compare options side by side.</p><p>By comparing these different design, you can find the best approach. Sometimes, the final design will combine ideas from both. And the extra effort up front? It’s worth it. It’s a lot quicker than fixing things later on.</p><h2 id="The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong"><a href="#The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="The Time I Got It Wrong"></a>The Time I Got It Wrong</h2><p>Let me tell you about a time when I got this wrong. I was tasked with designing a new feature for our system. I thought I had it all figured out and spent a whole week preparing. I came into the high-level design meeting, diagrams and everything, feeling confident. But then, a few critical questions came up—questions I hadn’t even thought about. My whole design fell apart right there.</p><p>Looking back, if I had designed it twice—if I had taken the time to think of alternatives—I would have been much better prepared. I could have answered those questions or even had a backup design ready. It was a big lesson in how easy it is to overlook important details when you rush with the first idea.</p><h2 id="Why-It-Matters"><a href="#Why-It-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why It Matters"></a>Why It Matters</h2><p>The point is, design isn’t just about getting something to work—it’s about getting it right. The “design it twice” idea helps you avoid bad decisions and spot better solutions. And the best part is, this approach doesn’t take a lot of extra time, but it improves the quality of your designs and sharpens your skills.</p><p>Recently, I summarized this chapter in my Telegram channel, <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">Byte-Sized Tech</a>, where I regularly post summaries of tech books and share interesting blog posts. I started summarizing this book because it’s full of valuable lessons I’ve picked up (sometimes the hard way) over the years.</p><p>This “design it twice” idea really hit home for me. If I had applied it earlier, I could’ve saved myself from some embarrassing moments. So, if you’re like me, trying to improve your design skills, this chapter—and my <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">channel</a>—might just help you avoid those pitfalls too.</p><p>The next time you’re working on a design, don’t just settle for the first idea. Take the time to come up with alternatives. You’ll make better choices, and you’ll feel a lot more confident walking into that next design meeting.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A big debate among developers is whether to write code for today’s problem or to build a general-purpose solution for future needs. Both approaches have their pros and cons. Specific-purpose code can quickly become messy. But overly general code can add unnecessary complexity. This post, obviously opinionated, argues for a middle ground. That’s the sweet spot, as always.</p><p>We will look at the dangers of overgeneralizing and not generalizing at all through two examples: a shopping cart and a vehicle rental system.</p><h2 id="Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code"><a href="#Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code"></a>Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code</h2><p>Imagine you’re building a shopping cart system, and you need to remove items. A specific-purpose solution might give you a method for each removal task, like this:</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShoppingCart</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveItemById</span>(<span class="params"><span class="built_in">string</span> itemId</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.Id == itemId);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveAllOutOfStockItems</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.IsOutOfStock);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ClearCart</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.Clear();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This works fine if your only goals are removing items by ID or clearing the cart. But the problems start to stack up fast:</p><ul><li><p>Cognitive Load: You’re adding a new method for each scenario. As you add features, the class becomes more cluttered. Want to add another removal condition? Get ready to write another method.</p></li><li><p>Shallow Design: Each method does one specific thing. That seems fine until you realize your interface is full of shallow, one-off methods. That makes it hard to maintain and extend.</p></li></ul><p>This approach is good for now.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>AI is the new bogeyman for software engineers</strong></em>. Every other day, some headline is screaming that AI is coming for our jobs, after all they do the job better, faster and they don’t need these long coffee breaks… If you’ve been losing sleep over these headlines, don’t worry—I’m sure there’s an AI that can help with that too.</p><p>But anyway, here’s the kicker—whether you think you’re replaceable by AI or you think you’re not—you’re right. (Yes, I paraphrased Henry Ford.)</p><p><em><strong>You are a code monkey</strong></em>. Let’s get real. If your job is to make basic CRUD apps, convert specs into code, or change a button’s color, then you should worry. AI is already chomping at the bit to automate the hell out of those tasks. Why? Because they are easy and repetitive.</p><blockquote><p>“Checklist: Are You a Code Monkey?”</p><ul><li><p>Spends 80% of your day renaming variables.</p></li><li><p>Thinks a “challenging task” is updating the color scheme.</p></li><li><p>Believing that creativity is choosing between a ‘for’ loop and a ‘while’ loop.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><em><strong>You are more than a code monkey(?)</strong></em>. AI can do the simple, repetitive stuff.</p><p>I use it daily for many things, for my own day job, and for some personal projects. One thing that is very noticeable is that for some tasks it is great! Queries? awesome, new CRUD for a model? Fantastic! Designing a system? Refactoring legacy code? Debugging difficult issues? Yeah, AI is not so great at that. These tasks need experience, intuition, and creativity. AI lacks these. AI can assist, suggest, give feedback, and automate parts of these tasks, but the heavy lifting?
