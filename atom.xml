    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all hear the word “ownership” at work. It often sounds like it means you have to be the one who does everything, solving every problem and handling every changing task until the project is done.</p><p>I used to think that way too. When I took on a project as “the owner,” I felt like asking for help was a weakness. I thought if I couldn’t figure something out by myself, it meant I wasn’t truly owning it. Does that sound familiar?</p><h2 id="What-I-believe-ownership-means"><a href="#What-I-believe-ownership-means" class="headerlink" title="What I believe ownership means"></a>What I believe ownership means</h2><p>You all know that projects get messy, requirements change often, and unexpected problems come up. You can’t plan for every single issue, and you can’t solve them all by yourself.</p><p>True ownership isn’t about working alone. It’s about being the person who is responsible for the project’s success or failure. And that is a very different way to look at it.</p><p>If a project fails because you tried to do everything by yourself and didn’t mention problems early enough, or if you didn’t ask for help when you needed it, then that’s on you. The “owner.”</p><h2 id="Trying-to-do-it-all-alone"><a href="#Trying-to-do-it-all-alone" class="headerlink" title="Trying to do it all alone"></a>Trying to do it all alone</h2><p>Think about a common situation: you’re leading an important integration, and you get stuck. Maybe the documentation isn’t complete, or the test environment isn’t working right. You spend days trying to fix it, believing you have to figure it out because you “own” this part. Your pride, or a wrong idea about responsibility, keeps you from speaking up.</p><p>By the time you finally say you’re stuck, a lot of time has been lost. The project timeline falls behind, and suddenly, the whole team feels the pressure. This isn’t about how good you are at coding; it’s about not truly owning the project. Your job as the owner wasn’t just to write the code. It was to make sure the project moved forward, even if that meant asking for help.</p><h2 id="What-you-should-do-instead"><a href="#What-you-should-do-instead" class="headerlink" title="What you should do instead"></a>What you should do instead</h2><p>So, if working alone isn’t necessarily ownership, what is?</p><ol><li><strong>Be the first to spot problems:</strong> Your main job as an owner is to see issues before they become big problems. This means looking at risks, understanding what depends on what, and noticing anything that could stop progress. When you see something, speak up quickly. Don’t let it get worse.</li><li><strong>Learn how to ask for help:</strong> This is perhaps the most important skill. Ownership means knowing when to bring in an expert, when to ask others for decisions, or when to simply say, “I’m stuck, can someone take a look?” It doesn’t show you’re weak; it shows you’re smart and committed to the project’s overall success.</li><li><strong>Lead, don’t just do:</strong> Sometimes, owning a problem means you’re the one who gets the right people together to solve it, instead of solving it yourself. You are the one who makes sure everyone has what they need and that roadblocks are removed.</li><li><strong>Talk all the time:</strong> Whether it’s good news, bad news, or “we need help” news, talking to people is your best tool. Keep everyone involved informed, manage what they expect, and be open about everything.</li></ol><hr><p>Understanding this bigger idea of ownership will make your projects go smoother. You’ll go from being the person who does everything to the person who makes sure everything gets done. </p><p>Next time you’re told to “own” a project, remember that it’s not about being the only one holding the shovel. It’s about being the one who makes sure we have enough shovels, and if we hit a big rock, you’re the first to point it out and get power tools, instead of hitting the rock with a shovel as hard as you can.</p><hr><h2 id="P-S-I-never-held-a-literal-shovel-I-hope-the-metaphor-sticks-with-the-shovel-experts"><a href="#P-S-I-never-held-a-literal-shovel-I-hope-the-metaphor-sticks-with-the-shovel-experts" class="headerlink" title="P.S.

    <title>Why sharing a redis cluster across services is asking for trouble</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If there’s one pattern I’ve seen across multiple companies, from scrappy startups to big corps, that causes endless headaches, it’s this: a single cache cluster shared across services.</p><p>I recently shortly wrote about <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2025/04/19/lessons-from-distributed-systems/">my lessons from building and maintaining distributed systems at scale</a>, and the first point that came to mind is exactly this - it starts with an excuse of simplicity, “we already have a cache cluster up and running, let’s just make this other service use it, no need for more infra”, and ends with a confused on-call engineer trying to debug which services were affected by the last keys eviction.</p><p>So I want to double down on this idea and explain in more detail why it becomes a nightmare once your system scales.</p><h2 id="One-eviction-policy"><a href="#One-eviction-policy" class="headerlink" title="One eviction policy"></a>One eviction policy</h2><p>You got different services each throwing keys at the same redis cluster.<br>A sudden spike&#x2F;bug just caused a dramatic increase in cache writes - your cluster wasn’t ready for this, it hits <code>maxmemory</code> and now different keys are being removed based on your eviction policy.</p><p>What’s the problem? there’s no isolation - service A caused the max memory, and now service B, C, D also pay the price - their keys are being removed as well from the cluster, and could affect the latency, and correctness of other flows of your system.</p><h2 id="Monitoring-is-harder"><a href="#Monitoring-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring is harder"></a>Monitoring is harder</h2><p>Our metric fires up — we see a drop in hit rate on the cluster. Which service is causing it? Who’s affected? Instead of thinking about one service, you’re now mentally juggling everything across the entire system. More noise, less clarity.</p><p>Although monitoring is harder, you could set up application monitors that you send once you write&#x2F;read from the cache, based on the prefix of the key. potentially if you are organized and each service that uses the cluster has a unique prefix and you can easily identify between the hit rates of different prefixes - that’s great, but you have to work to get there.</p><h2 id="Debugging-is-harder"><a href="#Debugging-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Debugging is harder"></a>Debugging is harder</h2><p>This ties back to my first point about the eviction policy.<br>You had 10m keys. something happend. now you got 5m.<br>The effect on the services is really hard to trace.<br>One service might have lost 100k keys, and you barely see a difference in its monitors, but it doesn’t mean your users are not feeling something is off, maybe today the are waiting a bit more for the page to load, but it’s not too long to hit your monitors thresholds.<br>In that case, if you didn’t have a monitor on the cache cluster for keys eviction, you might be totally blind..”oh I see a slight latency increase here, but no monitors popped - guess all is well”</p><h2 id="So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster"><a href="#So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster" class="headerlink" title="So, never use a shared cache cluster?"></a>So, never use a shared cache cluster?</h2><p>No, that’s not the lesson here.<br>In some cases it is totally fine to use a single cache cluster.<br>For example:</p><ul><li>You don’t really have a lot of traffic read&#x2F;written to the cache so most of it is free anyway</li><li>You store shared static data (for example, feature flags)</li></ul><p>Also note that some of the points I was making here against using a single cache cluster, can be somewhat mitigated by having good monitoring set in place.<br>For example, having a defined prefix for the cache key per use-case, per service, and publishing metrics in the application level so we have observability to which type of keys (by prefix) are experiecning a low hit ratio.</p><p>But on the other hand, tracking keys eviction is harder to monitor, since it’s not initiated by your system.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you get the point.<br>If you are getting started, a single cache cluster is totally fine.<br>Otherwise, spin up another cache cluster, and sleep better at night.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your architecture grows beyond a single container, things you thought were simple can now break in a variety of ways.<br>In this post I want to highlight different lessons I learned while developing and maintaining large distributed systems at scale.</p><h2 id="One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="One cache cluster to rule them all"></a>One cache cluster to rule them all</h2><p>When multiple services share one cache cluster, they compete for the same memory and eviction policies. A heavy workload from Service A can evict critical data for Service B, leading to timeouts or stale responses at peak traffic.<br>Now let’s say your cache memory is full, and the eviction policy you set starts triggering. You start seeing your TotalKeys metric going down drastically, you would want to understand immediately which service is affected, but it’s much more complex now.<br>On top of that, the affect on multiple services in that case might be even harder to detect, because if we have 5 services that use the cache, and now the eviction policy evicted millions of keys, it might be that one service lost 950k keys, and another lost 50k keys and that makes debugging harder.<br>If a single service would lose 1 million keys the affect on the service would probably be more noticeable on other metrics, but if we just lost 50k maybe that won’t affect the service as much? (obviously depending on the amount of keys this service has in cache)</p><p>This is very tempting to neglect because you can always just scale up your cluster, given you set monitors to detect when it will reach max memory.<br>Personally, I prefer to not deal with these issues, since spinning up a new cluster isn’t such a big of a deal.</p><h2 id="Queues-are-non-negotiable"><a href="#Queues-are-non-negotiable" class="headerlink" title="Queues are non-negotiable"></a>Queues are non-negotiable</h2><p>Once you have broken down your architecture from a single container to 2+ containers, that’s usually the time where you should introduce queues between those calls.<br>Queues help services handle spikey traffic. I like to think of it this way:</p><ol><li>a queue is the in-charge grown up.</li><li>a service is someone who has no backbone and can’t say ‘no’ until he explodes.</li></ol><p>if someone is bursting the service, the service won’t know how to say ‘no’ and will accept all the traffic till it explodes.<br>a queue will help us avoid this situation, while also buying us time to auto scale the service.</p><h2 id="Measuring-end-to-end-latency"><a href="#Measuring-end-to-end-latency" class="headerlink" title="Measuring end-to-end latency"></a>Measuring end-to-end latency</h2><p>You might think the e2e latency of your system is the sum of latency of services that are triggered in a flow, but there’s an additional latency you should think about in distributed systems - the dequeue latency, which is the amount of time a message was waiting in the queue before the service started processing it.<br>How can this happen? for example, when your service is not scaled up properly to handle all messages in the queue, so a backlog of messages is accumulating, waiting for the service to pick them up. this directly affects the latency of your entire system, so make sure you monitor that as well.</p><h2 id="Design-for-failure"><a href="#Design-for-failure" class="headerlink" title="Design for failure"></a>Design for failure</h2><p>Network failures, rate limiting, downstream services crashes - there are many reasons why your service can fail.<br>You should expect these failures and take them into consideration, so create a retry policy whenever you are making an API call to retry any transient exceptions, consider using circuit breakers so that you can stop calling a failing service until it recovers, and use a dead-letter queue to isolate messages that constantly fail so you can inspect them later.</p><h2 id="Design-for-idempotency"><a href="#Design-for-idempotency" class="headerlink" title="Design for idempotency"></a>Design for idempotency</h2><p>Message queues guarantee “at least once” delivery. Duplicates are expected. If your consumer isn’t idempotent, you’ll process the same event multiple times—charging a customer twice or creating duplicate records. Relying on “exactly once” delivery is a recipe for inconsistency. You need to assume duplicates will happen and handle them gracefully.</p><p>I once had to <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2023/07/15/idempotency-aws-lambda/">debug a nasty bug</a> in an AWS lambda that wasn’t idempotent and it was a pain in the ass.</p><hr><p>This is whatever was in the top of my head, hope you find it useful and you have a few ideas on how to improve your system.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <title>Stop reading tech books like fiction</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Stop reading tech books like novels. Read with intent. Read to solve problems. Otherwise, you’re just procrastinating with a smart-looking excuse.</p></blockquote><hr><p>There’s a lot of BS advice on the internet, but the one BS advice I want to rant on today is </p><blockquote><p>Read more tech books to become a better software engineer.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not entirely false, but the way people interpret it is the problem.</p><p>This all comes down to something super obvious, something everyone knows but still ignores because it’s uncomfortable, and hard :</p><blockquote><p><strong>Reading without applying knowledge is mostly useless</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>I fell into this trap multiple times. A book gets hyped (e.g <code>&quot;Refactoring&quot; is a must read for all engineers, made me 10x</code>). You buy it, read a few chapters, maybe even highlight some lines… then it quietly dies on your shelf.</p><h2 id="Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book"><a href="#Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book" class="headerlink" title="Why didn’t you finish the book?"></a>Why didn’t you finish the book?</h2><p>It’s a dumb question to ask, because - <strong>It’s not fiction</strong>!<br>There’s no meaning to finishing a tech book. At best, they’re a collection of insights - many of which don’t build on each other. You’re supposed to pick and choose what matters <em>right now</em>, not finish it cover to cover.</p><p>I fell hard for this trap. You crack open the book, skim the first few chapters—it’s stuff you sort of already know. But you tell yourself, “Real engineers finish books.”<br>So you grind through the slow parts, eyes half-glazed, waiting for the good stuff. Eventually, you hit the meaty chapters, and yeah, the insights are great.<br>You read them one-by-one thinking “wow the liskov substitution principle, cool idea”, “omg, singletons!”, “pff SOLID blew my mind”.<br>You close the book, the remote is in your hand, you turn on another episode of “The Office”.  </p><p>You wake up the next day, telling your co-workers “I started reading Clean Code”, and they think you are a douche because they now feel guilty they didn’t do something “productive” as you did.<br>You get back to your task, changing a color of a button and call it a day.<br>ON REPEAT.</p><hr><p>I’m not saying this to shame or guilt trip you, I’m saying it to set you free. </p><blockquote><p><strong>DON’T READ TECH BOOKS (AND DON’T LET ANYONE GUILT TRIP YOU ABOUT IT).</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you are not going to apply the knowledge right away, it is mostly useless. unless you are trying to impress someone in a shallow way (<em>“I read Clean Code, let’s do a refactor our code is not clean.”</em>).</p><h2 id="“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right"><a href="#“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right" class="headerlink" title="“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?"></a>“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?</h2><p>Nope, it might be even worse. Passive reading gives you the illusion of progress, you feel productive turning pages, highlighting quotes, maybe even bragging that you’re reading <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>, but none of it sticks.<br>You tell yourself you’re “learning,” so you don’t actually do anything. You don’t build. You don’t ship. You just read.</p><h2 id="The-right-way-to-read-books"><a href="#The-right-way-to-read-books" class="headerlink" title="The right way to read books"></a>The right way to read books</h2><p>Let me introduce you to how I read now: PDR – Problem-Driven Reading.<br>It’s the opposite of MDR – Marketing-Driven Reading.</p><p>MDR (Marketing-Driven-Reading): Tech influencers tell you it’s the best book ever, you should read it to become 10x or whatever.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Achievement Unlocked</em></strong>: you can join the hype train and guilt trip your coworkers even though you don’t recall a single detail from the single chapter you read.</p></blockquote><p>PDR (Problem-Driven-Reading): you have a problem you are trying to solve, you search the internet for a solution - they mention “oh you should use the SOLID principles for that”, and then you go read the Clean Code, specifically the parts about the SOLID principles - <strong>not cover to cover</strong>.<br>By the time you finish these chapters, you can immediately apply it to the problem at hand. </p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Achievement Unlocked</em></strong>: you actually learned something.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Does-it-mean-we-shouldn’t-read-just-to-explore"><a href="#Does-it-mean-we-shouldn’t-read-just-to-explore" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean we shouldn’t read just to explore?"></a>Does it mean we shouldn’t read just to explore?</h2><p>Exploring is fine, read whatever sparks your curiosity. But don’t confuse exploration with progress.<br>If you’re reading aimlessly, without a goal or problem to solve, be honest with yourself: are you actually learning, or just procrastinating with a smarter-looking excuse?</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <title>On over-engineering; Architecture Edition</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2024/09/07/future-proof-code/">wrote about over-engineering</a> and striking a good balance between making your code “too” future-proof and not making it future-proof at all. Some time later, I realized it was missing a critical perspective. I hadn’t addressed over-engineering from an architectural point of view, so this post is dedicated precisely to that.</p><p>Let’s talk about a decision I made for <a href="https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/Collecto">Collecto</a>, my side project. Collecto is still in its early stages, and like most early-stage projects, its future is uncertain. It could grow into something big—or not. That’s where architectural decisions get tricky. You don’t want to overengineer and waste time, but you also don’t want to under-engineer and regret not laying a solid foundation.</p><h3 id="So-what’s-the-problem"><a href="#So-what’s-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="So what’s the problem?"></a>So what’s the problem?</h3><p>Collecto is a forms-backend service, meaning it handles the creation, management, and processing of forms data for applications.<br>I wanted to add the ability to send emails on certain events.</p><p>For example, when a new user signs up for your form, you might want to send them a welcome email.</p><p>The simplest solution? I could write a new service responsible for sending emails and call it directly wherever needed— for example, right after a user signup is saved to the database. This approach works, is easy to set up, and introduces no additional overhead. However, it results in tight coupling, making future changes more challenging. If tomorrow I want to also send a notification to the form owner when they receive a new subscription, I would have to keep adding more responsibilities to the form service code. This bloats the core service, which should ideally focus solely on CRUD operations for forms.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, I could go all-in and build a distributed pub&#x2F;sub system with a service bus like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. This would give me scalability, decoupling, and all the good stuff. But it’s also a massive investment in time and complexity for a project that doesn’t need it, yet.</p><p>I didn’t like both options, so I looked for a 3rd alternative and found MediatR which is a mediator pattern implementation in .NET.</p><h3 id="Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground"><a href="#Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground" class="headerlink" title="Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?"></a>Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?</h3><ol><li><p>MediatR facilitates communication between different parts of the application without them needing to reference each other directly. Instead of invoking methods directly, you can send requests or publish notifications, allowing registered handlers to respond accordingly. This approach maintains loose coupling, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.</p></li><li><p>At the same time, it doesn’t introduce the overhead of managing infrastructure like a service bus or message queue. Everything stays in-process, simple, and fast.</p></li><li><p>One of the primary reasons I chose MediatR is its simplicity. Implementing communication patterns with MediatR is straightforward and requires minimal configuration. Compared to a full-fledged service bus, MediatR demands a much smaller time investment and eliminates operational overhead such as monitoring queues or scaling message brokers.</p></li></ol><h3 id="It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows"><a href="#It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows" class="headerlink" title="It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows"></a>It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows</h3><p>MediatR has a few cons compared to other out-of-process messaging brokers, for example</p><ol><li><p>Events are in-process only. If your application crashes, you lose the events.</p></li><li><p>There’s no out of the box retry mechanism for failed event handlers.</p></li><li><p>If you deploy multiple instances of Collecto, MediatR won’t distribute events across them.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h3><p>Architecture isn’t about perfection—it’s about trade-offs. MediatR worked for Collecto because it gave me a decoupled, flexible way to handle events without the overhead of a service bus. It wasn’t the simplest solution, but it was the right one for where the project is today.</p><p>The next time you’re making an architectural decision, remember this: the best solution isn’t the most impressive or complex—it’s the one that solves your problem now while leaving room for growth later.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost a month ago, <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2024/08/31/telegram-channel-announcement/">I created a telegram channel</a> with the goal of reading tech books consistently, and sharing summaries of them.<br>This week, I have finished reading the first book - <em>“A Philosophy of Software Design” by John Ousterhout</em> and shared all of the 21 chapter summaries in the <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">channel</a>.</p><p>In this post, I will share what are the 3 ideas that resonated with me the most.<br>The book is pretty packed with insights, and I think many junior-mid level software engineers can benefit from them, so I do encourage you to read it yourself!</p><h2 id="Idea-1-Zero-tolerance-towards-complexity"><a href="#Idea-1-Zero-tolerance-towards-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Idea 1: Zero-tolerance towards complexity"></a>Idea 1: Zero-tolerance towards complexity</h2><p>On the second chapter of the book, the author describes what is complexity and what are its symptoms:</p><ul><li><strong>Change amplification</strong>: a simple change requires changes in many different places.</li><li><strong>Cognitive load</strong>: the developer needs to learn a lot to complete a task.</li><li><strong>Unknown unknowns</strong>: it is not obvious which pieces of code need to change to complete a task.</li></ul><p>The author argues that complexity is not caused by a single error, it accumulates. Sometimes we convince ourselves that a bit of complexity here won’t matter much, but if everyone on the project adopts this mindset, the project will become complex rapidly.</p><p>“In order to slow the growth of complexity, you must adopt a zero-tolerance philosophy”.</p><h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>Imagine a simple order processing system where you calculate shipping costs, and apply discounts. However, this system is poorly designed with duplicated logic across multiple services, leading to change amplification. Let’s say both the <code>CheckoutService</code> and the <code>ShippingService</code> use the same logic to calculate discounts, but it’s implemented separately in both places.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">CheckoutService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateTotal</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> total = order.Items.Sum(item =&gt; item.Price);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            total -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> total;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShippingService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateShipping</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> shippingCost = order.ShippingAddress.Country == <span class="string">&quot;US&quot;</span> ? <span class="number">5</span> : <span class="number">15</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic (duplicated)</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            shippingCost -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> shippingCost;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Why-is-it-bad"><a href="#Why-is-it-bad" class="headerlink" title="Why is it bad?"></a>Why is it bad?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Change Amplification</strong>: If you want to modify how discounts are applied (e.g., introduce a new discount or change the criteria), you have to modify both <code>CheckoutService</code> and <code>ShippingService</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: Developers must remember to update every part of the system that touches discounts.

Resend; data corrupted? Recover from snapshot).</li><li>Abort the operation and pass the exception upward.</li></ul><p>The author mentions that aborting can add much more complexity. For example, if a data structure has been partially initialized, then an exception occurs - “The exception handling code must restore consistency, such as by unwinding any changes made before the exception occurred.”</p><p>The author notes how easy and tempting it is to throw an exception and let the caller handle it. He argues that, as the developer of a certain method, if you are having trouble handling a certain exception, there’s a good chance the caller won’t know how to deal with it either.</p><p>“The best way to reduce the complexity damage caused by exception handling is to reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled.”</p><p>From here, the author shares a few techniques on how to reduce the number of exception handlers.</p><ul><li><p>Define errors out of existence - “The best way to eliminate exception handling complexity is to define your APIs so that there are no exceptions to handle.” As an example, we can look at how file deletion is done on Windows compared to Linux. If you want to delete a file and it is open in another process, you will get an exception; you can’t perform the operation. In Linux, we can delete an open file - since we mark it for deletion at first. </p></li><li><p>Mask exceptions - “An exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system so that higher levels of software need not be aware of the condition.” For example, TCP masks packet loss by resending packets. So, higher-level software doesn’t need to know about the lost packets. It is guaranteed to have all packets.</p></li><li><p>Exception aggregation - “The idea behind exception aggregation is to handle many exceptions with a single piece of code; rather than writing distinct handlers for many individual exceptions, handle them all in one place with a single handler.”</p></li></ul><h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink"

    <title>Why you should &quot;design it twice&quot;?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing software is tough. I think we can all agree on that. No matter how much experience you have, your first idea about how to structure a module or system is usually not the best one. I had to learn this lesson the hard way, and I really wish I knew about the “design it twice” concept earlier in my career.</p><p>In Chapter 11 of A Philosophy of Software Design, the author introduces a simple but powerful idea: “design it twice”. The core message is that you shouldn’t just go with the first design that comes to mind. Instead, come up with at least two different designs even if you have to force yourself. No matter how confident you are, you’ll make better decisions when you compare options side by side.</p><p>By comparing these different design, you can find the best approach. Sometimes, the final design will combine ideas from both. And the extra effort up front? It’s worth it. It’s a lot quicker than fixing things later on.</p><h2 id="The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong"><a href="#The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="The Time I Got It Wrong"></a>The Time I Got It Wrong</h2><p>Let me tell you about a time when I got this wrong. I was tasked with designing a new feature for our system. I thought I had it all figured out and spent a whole week preparing. I came into the high-level design meeting, diagrams and everything, feeling confident. But then, a few critical questions came up—questions I hadn’t even thought about. My whole design fell apart right there.</p><p>Looking back, if I had designed it twice—if I had taken the time to think of alternatives—I would have been much better prepared. I could have answered those questions or even had a backup design ready. It was a big lesson in how easy it is to overlook important details when you rush with the first idea.</p><h2 id="Why-It-Matters"><a href="#Why-It-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why It Matters"></a>Why It Matters</h2><p>The point is, design isn’t just about getting something to work—it’s about getting it right. The “design it twice” idea helps you avoid bad decisions and spot better solutions. And the best part is, this approach doesn’t take a lot of extra time, but it improves the quality of your designs and sharpens your skills.</p><p>Recently, I summarized this chapter in my Telegram channel, <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">Byte-Sized Tech</a>, where I regularly post summaries of tech books and share interesting blog posts. I started summarizing this book because it’s full of valuable lessons I’ve picked up (sometimes the hard way) over the years.</p><p>This “design it twice” idea really hit home for me. If I had applied it earlier, I could’ve saved myself from some embarrassing moments. So, if you’re like me, trying to improve your design skills, this chapter—and my <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">channel</a>—might just help you avoid those pitfalls too.</p><p>The next time you’re working on a design, don’t just settle for the first idea. Take the time to come up with alternatives. You’ll make better choices, and you’ll feel a lot more confident walking into that next design meeting.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A big debate among developers is whether to write code for today’s problem or to build a general-purpose solution for future needs. Both approaches have their pros and cons. Specific-purpose code can quickly become messy. But overly general code can add unnecessary complexity. This post, obviously opinionated, argues for a middle ground. That’s the sweet spot, as always.</p><p>We will look at the dangers of overgeneralizing and not generalizing at all through two examples: a shopping cart and a vehicle rental system.</p><h2 id="Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code"><a href="#Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code"></a>Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code</h2><p>Imagine you’re building a shopping cart system, and you need to remove items. A specific-purpose solution might give you a method for each removal task, like this:</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShoppingCart</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveItemById</span>(<span class="params"><span class="built_in">string</span> itemId</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.Id == itemId);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveAllOutOfStockItems</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.IsOutOfStock);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ClearCart</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.Clear();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This works fine if your only goals are removing items by ID or clearing the cart. But the problems start to stack up fast:</p><ul><li><p>Cognitive Load: You’re adding a new method for each scenario. As you add features, the class becomes more cluttered. Want to add another removal condition? Get ready to write another method.</p></li><li><p>Shallow Design: Each method does one specific thing. That seems fine until you realize your interface is full of shallow, one-off methods. That makes it hard to maintain and extend.</p></li></ul><p>This approach is good for now.

Every other day, some headline is screaming that AI is coming for our jobs, after all they do the job better, faster and they don’t need these long coffee breaks… If you’ve been losing sleep over these headlines, don’t worry—I’m sure there’s an AI that can help with that too.</p><p>But anyway, here’s the kicker—whether you think you’re replaceable by AI or you think you’re not—you’re right. (Yes, I paraphrased Henry Ford.)</p><p><em><strong>You are a code monkey</strong></em>. Let’s get real. If your job is to make basic CRUD apps, convert specs into code, or change a button’s color, then you should worry. AI is already chomping at the bit to automate the hell out of those tasks. Why?

Queries? awesome, new CRUD for a model? Fantastic! Designing a system? Refactoring legacy code? Debugging difficult issues? Yeah, AI is not so great at that. These tasks need experience, intuition, and creativity. AI lacks these. AI can assist, suggest, give feedback, and automate parts of these tasks, but the heavy lifting? That still needs a human touch.</p><p>So, whether you think you are replaceable by AI or you think you are not—you’re right. If you reduce your work to translating specifications into code, then yes, AI might soon be able to do your job. But <em><strong>if you see yourself as a problem-solver and a critical thinker, you are irreplaceable.</strong></em> </p><hr><p>I hope that ages well, but if the robots take my job anytime soon, I’ll keep you updated.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“The market is tough” is something many juniors hear today. people are frustrated. graduating after 3-4 years with a CS degree is not easy.  They graduate only to find out nobody wants to hire them or even move forward beyond the initial screening.</p><p>I’ll be real with you. there’s a chance you are not enough.</p><p>when I say you might not be enough, I don’t mean it in a “gate-keepy” way. I mean that the way you present yourself right now might not be impressive. that’s good news because you can fix it. it is not necessarily a “cosmetic” change alone, you might need to do more impressive things to present.</p><p>let’s face it, if you graduated from college with a CS degree, without anything impressive to share, most chances you are doomed. the bare minimum doesn’t cut it. there are hundreds of candidates for each junior position.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: although I only explicitly mention CS degrees, the below advice applies to bootcamp grads or self-taught devs… obviously…</p><p>here are the tips make the most sense in that situation</p><ul><li><p>realize you are the problem - prerequisite step. (the company&#x2F;recruiter is not to blame, they didn’t miss out on you because you got an auto rejection, and there are too many candidates)</p></li><li><p>seek feedback &amp; improve resume - there’s a ton of content on how to improve a resume - look it up. also, you can post your resume on linkedin, reddit, etc., and ask to get honest feedback on it.</p></li><li><p>education isn’t enough - do personal projects. explain what you built, what skills you acquired, what challenges you had, and share your code.</p></li><li><p>apply through friends or random people on linkedin that work where you want to apply - DM them.</p></li><li><p>lower your expectations - your first job doesn’t have to be glamorous, or even pay well. get any job as a dev.</p></li><li><p>seek mentorship - find someone who is a few steps ahead of you, and ask for their tailored advice for your specific situation. (I am available for questions, see <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">here</a>).</p></li></ul><hr><p>I applied all these tips myself ~4.5 years ago.</p><p>my first job as a dev was in a lab in the uni I studied in. I got paid minimum wage - but that line on the resume a year later was priceless.</p><hr><blockquote><p>“Well I have been trying all of that for months, and nothing changed - what now?!”</p></blockquote><p>There are two options. you either didn’t apply the advice well enough - seek mentorship.<br>or you just need to lower the bar for the roles you apply for. your first job might not be a dev job. it can be qa, data analyst, or anything else that is close enough to a dev role so that you can make the jump within the company.</p><p>I am not a fan of sugar-coating so I’ll be blunt with you… if you didn’t find a job in 6 months, and you aren’t doing anything about it besides spamming recruiters, most chances it ain’t happening this month too. progress is not achieved passively. figure out your weaknesses and iteratively get better.</p><hr><p>oh, and a few more tips… once you do get a technical interview put emphasis on the following</p><ul><li><p>show you are coachable - you know how to receive feedback and adapt.</p></li><li><p>show your passion - talk about your projects with passion, explain the decisions you had to make, and why you made them.</p></li><li><p>show your skill - code fluently in a single language at the very least.

    <title>SWE laws of power</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed how some software engineers seem to rocket up the career ladder, while others, just as talented, barely move? It’s not always about how good you are with code; sometimes, it’s about playing the game smartly. This got me thinking when I was reading “The 48 Laws of Power.” It struck me that many of these laws could be specially adapted. So, I chose the 5 laws that I think are most relevant and impactful for software engineers.</p><p>As a side note, the experience of reading the book wasn’t just about entertainment; it helped me see the everyday subtle manipulations we often overlook. But remember, if that’s the game, you can’t hate the players. Although a more honest title for this book might be “48 Laws of Manipulation,” it probably wouldn’t sell as well, because let’s face it—‘power’ sounds a lot more appealing.</p><p>Banter aside, the book does contain some solid tips or laws that go beyond mere manipulation.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER:</em></strong>  Rules are made to be broken.</p></blockquote><p>Anyway…</p><h2 id="1-Never-outshine-the-master"><a href="#1-Never-outshine-the-master" class="headerlink" title="1. Never outshine the master"></a>1. Never outshine the master</h2><blockquote><p>Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.</p></blockquote><p>You are ambitious, you want to get promoted, so you develop something that you think can be very impactful for the company (for example), and you go presenting it to your VP instead of going through your superior first - BAD.</p><p>This kind of thing will make your superior feel undermined and uncomfortable, and it can also reflect on you as someone who does not respect “the chain of command”.</p><p>You’d want to involve your superior, as most likely, they will be the ones that need to drive the process to your promotion - if they think you are trying to undermine them that promo is definitely less likely.</p><h2 id="2-Concentrate-Your-Forces"><a href="#2-Concentrate-Your-Forces" class="headerlink" title="2. Concentrate Your Forces"></a>2. Concentrate Your Forces</h2><blockquote><p>Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another—intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.</p></blockquote><p>This one’s actually not a manipulation, and a general good tip.<br>In the context of a software engineer that wants to get promoted, I’d say this law is all about, focusing on your goals defined by you and your superior, and about being an expert of a specific technology that the comapny is using - esentially be the “go-to guy&#x2F;girl” for any questions or advice on a specific tech.</p><h2 id="3-Win-through-your-actions-never-through-argument"><a href="#3-Win-through-your-actions-never-through-argument" class="headerlink" title="3. Win through your actions, never through argument"></a>3. Win through your actions, never through argument</h2><blockquote><p>Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.</p></blockquote><p>Being opinionated is somewhat a part of the job, but you don’t have to get argumentative over every “debate”, choose your battles.<br>After all, you will have to continue working with the team you argue with, and if you are teammed up with people that are less argumentative, you might make them resent you, even (or especially) if you are right (and when they refuse to admit it).</p><p>This rule kinda sucks, as I find good arguments when both sides are not insecure to be very productive, but that’s why you have to choose your battles depending if the topic truly worth arguing about, and the personality of who you will be arguing with… it can do more harm than good, even if you are right (yeah that truly sucks).</p><h2 id="4-Make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless"><a href="#4-Make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless" class="headerlink" title="4. Make your accomplishments seem effortless"></a>4. Make your accomplishments seem effortless</h2><blockquote><p>Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work—it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some think exposure to how hard they work and practice demonstrates diligence and honesty, but really it just shows weakness. What is understandable is not awe-inspiring.  The more mystery surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems. </p></blockquote><p>This one’s pretty straightforward even in the context of a software engineer, but just for the sake of clearness, here’s an example:</p><blockquote><p>“Wow, how do you manage code-review your teammates so consistently and still be on top of your work?”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Ah that’s nothing, I still work 3 hours a day”</p></blockquote><p>Don’t tell them about your chatgpt automations, no matter what.</p><p>(kind of a joke, but you get the idea)</p><h2 id="5-Always-say-less-than-necessary"><a href="#5-Always-say-less-than-necessary" class="headerlink" title="5. Always say less than necessary"></a>5. Always say less than necessary</h2><blockquote><p>When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.</p></blockquote><p>This can be applied to many things, for example</p><p>When you are in a technical disscusion, try to speak concisely and focus on delivering impactful, well-thought-out comments. Instead of trying to contribute to every topic, with whatever comes to mind. You want to be seen thoughtful and deliberate. (I never appreciated the ones who comment just for the sake of commenting, with something obvious and negligble, don’t be that guy&#x2F;girl.)</p><hr><p>That’s it.<br>I do some <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">mentoring</a> btw.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>
