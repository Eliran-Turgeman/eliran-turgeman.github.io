      <title>Confusing ownership with heroism</title>
      <link href="/2025/05/23/heoric-ownership/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all hear the word “ownership” at work. It often sounds like it means you have to be the one who does everything, solving every problem and handling every changing task until the project is done.</p><p>I used to think that way too. When I took on a project as “the owner,” I felt like asking for help was a weakness. I thought if I couldn’t figure something out by myself, it meant I wasn’t truly owning it. Does that sound familiar?</p><h2 id="What-I-believe-ownership-means"><a href="#What-I-believe-ownership-means" class="headerlink" title="What I believe ownership means"></a>What I believe ownership means</h2><p>You all know that projects get messy, requirements change often, and unexpected problems come up. You can’t plan for every single issue, and you can’t solve them all by yourself.</p><p>True ownership isn’t about working alone. It’s about being the person who is responsible for the project’s success or failure. And that is a very different way to look at it.</p><p>If a project fails because you tried to do everything by yourself and didn’t mention problems early enough, or if you didn’t ask for help when you needed it, then that’s on you. The “owner.”</p><h2 id="Trying-to-do-it-all-alone"><a href="#Trying-to-do-it-all-alone" class="headerlink" title="Trying to do it all alone"></a>Trying to do it all alone</h2><p>Think about a common situation: you’re leading an important integration, and you get stuck. Maybe the documentation isn’t complete, or the test environment isn’t working right. You spend days trying to fix it, believing you have to figure it out because you “own” this part. Your pride, or a wrong idea about responsibility, keeps you from speaking up.</p><p>By the time you finally say you’re stuck, a lot of time has been lost. The project timeline falls behind, and suddenly, the whole team feels the pressure. This isn’t about how good you are at coding; it’s about not truly owning the project. Your job as the owner wasn’t just to write the code. It was to make sure the project moved forward, even if that meant asking for help.</p><h2 id="What-you-should-do-instead"><a href="#What-you-should-do-instead" class="headerlink" title="What you should do instead"></a>What you should do instead</h2><p>So, if working alone isn’t necessarily ownership, what is?</p><ol><li><strong>Be the first to spot problems:</strong> Your main job as an owner is to see issues before they become big problems. This means looking at risks, understanding what depends on what, and noticing anything that could stop progress. When you see something, speak up quickly. Don’t let it get worse.</li><li><strong>Learn how to ask for help:</strong> This is perhaps the most important skill. Ownership means knowing when to bring in an expert, when to ask others for decisions, or when to simply say, “I’m stuck, can someone take a look?” It doesn’t show you’re weak; it shows you’re smart and committed to the project’s overall success.</li><li><strong>Lead, don’t just do:</strong> Sometimes, owning a problem means you’re the one who gets the right people together to solve it, instead of solving it yourself. You are the one who makes sure everyone has what they need and that roadblocks are removed.</li><li><strong>Talk all the time:</strong> Whether it’s good news, bad news, or “we need help” news, talking to people is your best tool. Keep everyone involved informed, manage what they expect, and be open about everything.</li></ol><hr><p>Understanding this bigger idea of ownership will make your projects go smoother. You’ll go from being the person who does everything to the person who makes sure everything gets done. </p><p>Next time you’re told to “own” a project, remember that it’s not about being the only one holding the shovel. It’s about being the one who makes sure we have enough shovels, and if we hit a big rock, you’re the first to point it out and get power tools, instead of hitting the rock with a shovel as hard as you can.</p><hr><p>P.S. I never held a literal shovel. I hope the metaphor sticks with the shovel experts.</p><hr><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Why sharing a redis cluster across services is asking for trouble</title>
      <link href="/2025/05/01/one-cache-cluster/"/>
      <url>/2025/05/01/one-cache-cluster/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If there’s one pattern I’ve seen across multiple companies, from scrappy startups to big corps, that causes endless headaches, it’s this: a single cache cluster shared across services.</p><p>I recently shortly wrote about <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2025/04/19/lessons-from-distributed-systems/">my lessons from building and maintaining distributed systems at scale</a>, and the first point that came to mind is exactly this - it starts with an excuse of simplicity, “we already have a cache cluster up and running, let’s just make this other service use it, no need for more infra”, and ends with a confused on-call engineer trying to debug which services were affected by the last keys eviction.</p><p>So I want to double down on this idea and explain in more detail why it becomes a nightmare once your system scales.</p><h2 id="One-eviction-policy"><a href="#One-eviction-policy" class="headerlink" title="One eviction policy"></a>One eviction policy</h2><p>You got different services each throwing keys at the same redis cluster.<br>A sudden spike&#x2F;bug just caused a dramatic increase in cache writes - your cluster wasn’t ready for this, it hits <code>maxmemory</code> and now different keys are being removed based on your eviction policy.</p><p>What’s the problem? there’s no isolation - service A caused the max memory, and now service B, C, D also pay the price - their keys are being removed as well from the cluster, and could affect the latency, and correctness of other flows of your system.</p><h2 id="Monitoring-is-harder"><a href="#Monitoring-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring is harder"></a>Monitoring is harder</h2><p>Our metric fires up — we see a drop in hit rate on the cluster. Which service is causing it? Who’s affected? Instead of thinking about one service, you’re now mentally juggling everything across the entire system. More noise, less clarity.</p><p>Although monitoring is harder, you could set up application monitors that you send once you write&#x2F;read from the cache, based on the prefix of the key. potentially if you are organized and each service that uses the cluster has a unique prefix and you can easily identify between the hit rates of different prefixes - that’s great, but you have to work to get there.</p><h2 id="Debugging-is-harder"><a href="#Debugging-is-harder" class="headerlink" title="Debugging is harder"></a>Debugging is harder</h2><p>This ties back to my first point about the eviction policy.<br>You had 10m keys. something happend. now you got 5m.<br>The effect on the services is really hard to trace.<br>One service might have lost 100k keys, and you barely see a difference in its monitors, but it doesn’t mean your users are not feeling something is off, maybe today the are waiting a bit more for the page to load, but it’s not too long to hit your monitors thresholds.<br>In that case, if you didn’t have a monitor on the cache cluster for keys eviction, you might be totally blind..”oh I see a slight latency increase here, but no monitors popped - guess all is well”</p><h2 id="So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster"><a href="#So-never-use-a-shared-cache-cluster" class="headerlink" title="So, never use a shared cache cluster?"></a>So, never use a shared cache cluster?</h2><p>No, that’s not the lesson here.<br>In some cases it is totally fine to use a single cache cluster.<br>For example:</p><ul><li>You don’t really have a lot of traffic read&#x2F;written to the cache so most of it is free anyway</li><li>You store shared static data (for example, feature flags)</li></ul><p>Also note that some of the points I was making here against using a single cache cluster, can be somewhat mitigated by having good monitoring set in place.<br>For example, having a defined prefix for the cache key per use-case, per service, and publishing metrics in the application level so we have observability to which type of keys (by prefix) are experiecning a low hit ratio.</p><p>But on the other hand, tracking keys eviction is harder to monitor, since it’s not initiated by your system.</p><p>Anyway, I hope you get the point.<br>If you are getting started, a single cache cluster is totally fine.<br>Otherwise, spin up another cache cluster, and sleep better at night.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Lessons from building and maintaining distributed systems at scale</title>
      <link href="/2025/04/19/lessons-from-distributed-systems/"/>
      <url>/2025/04/19/lessons-from-distributed-systems/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When your architecture grows beyond a single container, things you thought were simple can now break in a variety of ways.<br>In this post I want to highlight different lessons I learned while developing and maintaining large distributed systems at scale.</p><h2 id="One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all"><a href="#One-cache-cluster-to-rule-them-all" class="headerlink" title="One cache cluster to rule them all"></a>One cache cluster to rule them all</h2><p>When multiple services share one cache cluster, they compete for the same memory and eviction policies. A heavy workload from Service A can evict critical data for Service B, leading to timeouts or stale responses at peak traffic.<br>Now let’s say your cache memory is full, and the eviction policy you set starts triggering. You start seeing your TotalKeys metric going down drastically, you would want to understand immediately which service is affected, but it’s much more complex now.<br>On top of that, the affect on multiple services in that case might be even harder to detect, because if we have 5 services that use the cache, and now the eviction policy evicted millions of keys, it might be that one service lost 950k keys, and another lost 50k keys and that makes debugging harder.<br>If a single service would lose 1 million keys the affect on the service would probably be more noticeable on other metrics, but if we just lost 50k maybe that won’t affect the service as much? (obviously depending on the amount of keys this service has in cache)</p><p>This is very tempting to neglect because you can always just scale up your cluster, given you set monitors to detect when it will reach max memory.<br>Personally, I prefer to not deal with these issues, since spinning up a new cluster isn’t such a big of a deal.</p><h2 id="Queues-are-non-negotiable"><a href="#Queues-are-non-negotiable" class="headerlink" title="Queues are non-negotiable"></a>Queues are non-negotiable</h2><p>Once you have broken down your architecture from a single container to 2+ containers, that’s usually the time where you should introduce queues between those calls.<br>Queues help services handle spikey traffic. I like to think of it this way:</p><ol><li>a queue is the in-charge grown up.</li><li>a service is someone who has no backbone and can’t say ‘no’ until he explodes.</li></ol><p>if someone is bursting the service, the service won’t know how to say ‘no’ and will accept all the traffic till it explodes.<br>a queue will help us avoid this situation, while also buying us time to auto scale the service.</p><h2 id="Measuring-end-to-end-latency"><a href="#Measuring-end-to-end-latency" class="headerlink" title="Measuring end-to-end latency"></a>Measuring end-to-end latency</h2><p>You might think the e2e latency of your system is the sum of latency of services that are triggered in a flow, but there’s an additional latency you should think about in distributed systems - the dequeue latency, which is the amount of time a message was waiting in the queue before the service started processing it.<br>How can this happen? for example, when your service is not scaled up properly to handle all messages in the queue, so a backlog of messages is accumulating, waiting for the service to pick them up. this directly affects the latency of your entire system, so make sure you monitor that as well.</p><h2 id="Design-for-failure"><a href="#Design-for-failure" class="headerlink" title="Design for failure"></a>Design for failure</h2><p>Network failures, rate limiting, downstream services crashes - there are many reasons why your service can fail.<br>You should expect these failures and take them into consideration, so create a retry policy whenever you are making an API call to retry any transient exceptions, consider using circuit breakers so that you can stop calling a failing service until it recovers, and use a dead-letter queue to isolate messages that constantly fail so you can inspect them later.</p><h2 id="Design-for-idempotency"><a href="#Design-for-idempotency" class="headerlink" title="Design for idempotency"></a>Design for idempotency</h2><p>Message queues guarantee “at least once” delivery. Duplicates are expected. If your consumer isn’t idempotent, you’ll process the same event multiple times—charging a customer twice or creating duplicate records. Relying on “exactly once” delivery is a recipe for inconsistency. You need to assume duplicates will happen and handle them gracefully.</p><p>I once had to <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2023/07/15/idempotency-aws-lambda/">debug a nasty bug</a> in an AWS lambda that wasn’t idempotent and it was a pain in the ass.</p><hr><p>This is whatever was in the top of my head, hope you find it useful and you have a few ideas on how to improve your system.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Stop reading tech books like fiction</title>

      <url>/2025/04/11/reading-wrong/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>TL;DR: Stop reading tech books like novels. Read with intent. Read to solve problems. Otherwise, you’re just procrastinating with a smart-looking excuse.</p></blockquote><hr><p>There’s a lot of BS advice on the internet, but the one BS advice I want to rant on today is </p><blockquote><p>Read more tech books to become a better software engineer.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not entirely false, but the way people interpret it is the problem.</p><p>This all comes down to something super obvious, something everyone knows but still ignores because it’s uncomfortable, and hard :</p><blockquote><p><strong>Reading without applying knowledge is mostly useless</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>I fell into this trap multiple times. A book gets hyped (e.g <code>&quot;Refactoring&quot; is a must read for all engineers, made me 10x</code>). You buy it, read a few chapters, maybe even highlight some lines… then it quietly dies on your shelf.</p><h2 id="Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book"><a href="#Why-didn’t-you-finish-the-book" class="headerlink" title="Why didn’t you finish the book?"></a>Why didn’t you finish the book?</h2><p>It’s a dumb question to ask, because - <strong>It’s not fiction</strong>!<br>There’s no meaning to finishing a tech book. At best, they’re a collection of insights - many of which don’t build on each other. You’re supposed to pick and choose what matters <em>right now</em>, not finish it cover to cover.</p><p>I fell hard for this trap. You crack open the book, skim the first few chapters—it’s stuff you sort of already know. But you tell yourself, “Real engineers finish books.”<br>So you grind through the slow parts, eyes half-glazed, waiting for the good stuff. Eventually, you hit the meaty chapters, and yeah, the insights are great.<br>You read them one-by-one thinking “wow the liskov substitution principle, cool idea”, “omg, singletons!”, “pff SOLID blew my mind”.<br>You close the book, the remote is in your hand, you turn on another episode of “The Office”.  </p><p>You wake up the next day, telling your co-workers “I started reading Clean Code”, and they think you are a douche because they now feel guilty they didn’t do something “productive” as you did.<br>You get back to your task, changing a color of a button and call it a day.<br>ON REPEAT.</p><hr><p>I’m not saying this to shame or guilt trip you, I’m saying it to set you free. </p><blockquote><p><strong>DON’T READ TECH BOOKS (AND DON’T LET ANYONE GUILT TRIP YOU ABOUT IT).</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you are not going to apply the knowledge right away, it is mostly useless. unless you are trying to impress someone in a shallow way (<em>“I read Clean Code, let’s do a refactor our code is not clean.”</em>).</p><h2 id="“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right"><a href="#“But-reading-and-not-applying-it-must-be-better-than-not-reading-at-all”-right" class="headerlink" title="“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?"></a>“But reading and not applying it must be better than not reading at all”, right?</h2><p>Nope, it might be even worse. Passive reading gives you the illusion of progress, you feel productive turning pages, highlighting quotes, maybe even bragging that you’re reading <em>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</em>, but none of it sticks.<br>You tell yourself you’re “learning,” so you don’t actually do anything. You don’t build. You don’t ship. You just read.</p><h2 id="The-right-way-to-read-books"><a href="#The-right-way-to-read-books" class="headerlink" title="The right way to read books"></a>The right way to read books</h2><p>Let me introduce you to how I read now: PDR – Problem-Driven Reading.<br>It’s the opposite of MDR – Marketing-Driven Reading.</p><p>MDR (Marketing-Driven-Reading): Tech influencers tell you it’s the best book ever, you should read it to become 10x or whatever.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Achievement Unlocked</em></strong>: you can join the hype train and guilt trip your coworkers even though you don’t recall a single detail from the single chapter you read.</p></blockquote><p>PDR (Problem-Driven-Reading): you have a problem you are trying to solve, you search the internet for a solution - they mention “oh you should use the SOLID principles for that”, and then you go read the Clean Code, specifically the parts about the SOLID principles - <strong>not cover to cover</strong>.<br>By the time you finish these chapters, you can immediately apply it to the problem at hand. </p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Achievement Unlocked</em></strong>: you actually learned something.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Does-it-mean-we-shouldn’t-read-just-to-explore"><a href="#Does-it-mean-we-shouldn’t-read-just-to-explore" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean we shouldn’t read just to explore?"></a>Does it mean we shouldn’t read just to explore?</h2><p>Exploring is fine, read whatever sparks your curiosity. But don’t confuse exploration with progress.<br>If you’re reading aimlessly, without a goal or problem to solve, be honest with yourself: are you actually learning, or just procrastinating with a smarter-looking excuse?</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>On over-engineering; Architecture Edition</title>
      <link href="/2024/12/10/overengineering-architecture/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2024/09/07/future-proof-code/">wrote about over-engineering</a> and striking a good balance between making your code “too” future-proof and not making it future-proof at all. Some time later, I realized it was missing a critical perspective. I hadn’t addressed over-engineering from an architectural point of view, so this post is dedicated precisely to that.</p><p>Let’s talk about a decision I made for <a href="https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/Collecto">Collecto</a>, my side project. Collecto is still in its early stages, and like most early-stage projects, its future is uncertain. It could grow into something big—or not. That’s where architectural decisions get tricky. You don’t want to overengineer and waste time, but you also don’t want to under-engineer and regret not laying a solid foundation.</p><h3 id="So-what’s-the-problem"><a href="#So-what’s-the-problem" class="headerlink" title="So what’s the problem?"></a>So what’s the problem?</h3><p>Collecto is a forms-backend service, meaning it handles the creation, management, and processing of forms data for applications.<br>I wanted to add the ability to send emails on certain events.</p><p>For example, when a new user signs up for your form, you might want to send them a welcome email.</p><p>The simplest solution? I could write a new service responsible for sending emails and call it directly wherever needed— for example, right after a user signup is saved to the database. This approach works, is easy to set up, and introduces no additional overhead. However, it results in tight coupling, making future changes more challenging. If tomorrow I want to also send a notification to the form owner when they receive a new subscription, I would have to keep adding more responsibilities to the form service code. This bloats the core service, which should ideally focus solely on CRUD operations for forms.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, I could go all-in and build a distributed pub&#x2F;sub system with a service bus like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus. This would give me scalability, decoupling, and all the good stuff. But it’s also a massive investment in time and complexity for a project that doesn’t need it, yet.</p><p>I didn’t like both options, so I looked for a 3rd alternative and found MediatR which is a mediator pattern implementation in .NET.</p><h3 id="Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground"><a href="#Why-MediatR-is-a-good-middle-ground" class="headerlink" title="Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?"></a>Why MediatR is a good middle-ground?</h3><ol><li><p>MediatR facilitates communication between different parts of the application without them needing to reference each other directly. Instead of invoking methods directly, you can send requests or publish notifications, allowing registered handlers to respond accordingly. This approach maintains loose coupling, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.</p></li><li><p>At the same time, it doesn’t introduce the overhead of managing infrastructure like a service bus or message queue. Everything stays in-process, simple, and fast.</p></li><li><p>One of the primary reasons I chose MediatR is its simplicity. Implementing communication patterns with MediatR is straightforward and requires minimal configuration. Compared to a full-fledged service bus, MediatR demands a much smaller time investment and eliminates operational overhead such as monitoring queues or scaling message brokers.</p></li></ol><h3 id="It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows"><a href="#It-can’t-be-all-sunshines-and-rainbows" class="headerlink" title="It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows"></a>It can’t be all sunshines and rainbows</h3><p>MediatR has a few cons compared to other out-of-process messaging brokers, for example</p><ol><li><p>Events are in-process only. If your application crashes, you lose the events.</p></li><li><p>There’s no out of the box retry mechanism for failed event handlers.</p></li><li><p>If you deploy multiple instances of Collecto, MediatR won’t distribute events across them.</p></li></ol><h3 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h3><p>Architecture isn’t about perfection—it’s about trade-offs. MediatR worked for Collecto because it gave me a decoupled, flexible way to handle events without the overhead of a service bus. It wasn’t the simplest solution, but it was the right one for where the project is today.</p><p>The next time you’re making an architectural decision, remember this: the best solution isn’t the most impressive or complex—it’s the one that solves your problem now while leaving room for growth later.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Ideas from &quot;A Philosophy of Software Design&quot;</title>

Sometimes we convince ourselves that a bit of complexity here won’t matter much, but if everyone on the project adopts this mindset, the project will become complex rapidly.</p><p>“In order to slow the growth of complexity, you must adopt a zero-tolerance philosophy”.</p><h3 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>Imagine a simple order processing system where you calculate shipping costs, and apply discounts. However, this system is poorly designed with duplicated logic across multiple services, leading to change amplification. Let’s say both the <code>CheckoutService</code> and the <code>ShippingService</code> use the same logic to calculate discounts, but it’s implemented separately in both places.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">CheckoutService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateTotal</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> total = order.Items.Sum(item =&gt; item.Price);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            total -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> total;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShippingService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">decimal</span> <span class="title">CalculateShipping</span>(<span class="params">Order order</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="built_in">decimal</span> shippingCost = order.ShippingAddress.Country == <span class="string">&quot;US&quot;</span> ? <span class="number">5</span> : <span class="number">15</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Apply discount logic (duplicated)</span></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (order.CouponCode == <span class="string">&quot;SUMMER2024&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            shippingCost -= <span class="number">10</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> shippingCost;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Why-is-it-bad"><a href="#Why-is-it-bad" class="headerlink" title="Why is it bad?"></a>Why is it bad?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Change Amplification</strong>: If you want to modify how discounts are applied (e.g., introduce a new discount or change the criteria), you have to modify both <code>CheckoutService</code> and <code>ShippingService</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cognitive Load</strong>: Developers must remember to update every part of the system that touches discounts.

For example, if whenever I use method A, I always use method B and vice versa, then the methods should be merged.</li><li>“They overlap conceptually, in that there is a simple higher-level category that includes both of the pieces of code”</li><li>“It is hard to understand one of the pieces of code without looking at the other.”</li></ul><p>The author mentions the common “clean tip”: “Split up any method longer than X lines.” He adds that “length by itself is rarely a good reason for splitting up a method.” […] Splitting up a method introduces additional interfaces, which add to complexity. […] You shouldn’t break up a method unless it makes the overall system simpler”.</p><h3 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h3><p>In this example, let’s say we have a user registration process in a system. The developer has over-split the logic into multiple methods, separating each step of the registration, such as validating the user, saving the user to the database, and sending a welcome email. While each method is doing its own thing, they all share information and are conceptually related. This over-splitting leads to unnecessary complexity and overhead.</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">UserService</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="built_in">bool</span> <span class="title">ValidateUser</span>(<span class="params">User user</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="built_in">string</span>.IsNullOrEmpty(user.Email))</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> ArgumentException(<span class="string">&quot;Email is required.&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">true</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">SaveUserToDatabase</span>(<span class="params">User user</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        Database.Save(user);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">SendWelcomeEmail</span>(<span class="params">User user</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        EmailService.Send(<span class="string">&quot;Welcome to our platform!&quot;</span>, user.Email);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RegisterUser</span>(<span class="params">User user</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (ValidateUser(user))</span><br><span class="line">        &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            SaveUserToDatabase(user);</span><br><span class="line">            SendWelcomeEmail(user);</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Why-is-it-bad-1"><a href="#Why-is-it-bad-1" class="headerlink" title="Why is it bad?"></a>Why is it bad?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Unnecessary Subdivision</strong>: The <code>ValidateUser</code>, <code>SaveUserToDatabase</code>, and <code>SendWelcomeEmail</code> methods are too granular and are always used together in a strict sequence.

Resend; data corrupted? Recover from snapshot).</li><li>Abort the operation and pass the exception upward.</li></ul><p>The author mentions that aborting can add much more complexity. For example, if a data structure has been partially initialized, then an exception occurs - “The exception handling code must restore consistency, such as by unwinding any changes made before the exception occurred.”</p><p>The author notes how easy and tempting it is to throw an exception and let the caller handle it. He argues that, as the developer of a certain method, if you are having trouble handling a certain exception, there’s a good chance the caller won’t know how to deal with it either.</p><p>“The best way to reduce the complexity damage caused by exception handling is to reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled.”</p><p>From here, the author shares a few techniques on how to reduce the number of exception handlers.</p><ul><li><p>Define errors out of existence - “The best way to eliminate exception handling complexity is to define your APIs so that there are no exceptions to handle.” As an example, we can look at how file deletion is done on Windows compared to Linux. If you want to delete a file and it is open in another process, you will get an exception; you can’t perform the operation. In Linux, we can delete an open file - since we mark it for deletion at first. </p></li><li><p>Mask exceptions - “An exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system so that higher levels of software need not be aware of the condition.” For example, TCP masks packet loss by resending packets. So, higher-level software doesn’t need to know about the lost packets. It is guaranteed to have all packets.</p></li><li><p>Exception aggregation - “The idea behind exception aggregation is to handle many exceptions with a single piece of code; rather than writing distinct handlers for many individual exceptions, handle them all in one place with a single handler.”</p></li></ul><h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink"

      <title>Why you should &quot;design it twice&quot;?</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/14/design-it-twice/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing software is tough. I think we can all agree on that. No matter how much experience you have, your first idea about how to structure a module or system is usually not the best one. I had to learn this lesson the hard way, and I really wish I knew about the “design it twice” concept earlier in my career.</p><p>In Chapter 11 of A Philosophy of Software Design, the author introduces a simple but powerful idea: “design it twice”. The core message is that you shouldn’t just go with the first design that comes to mind. Instead, come up with at least two different designs even if you have to force yourself. No matter how confident you are, you’ll make better decisions when you compare options side by side.</p><p>By comparing these different design, you can find the best approach. Sometimes, the final design will combine ideas from both. And the extra effort up front? It’s worth it. It’s a lot quicker than fixing things later on.</p><h2 id="The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong"><a href="#The-Time-I-Got-It-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="The Time I Got It Wrong"></a>The Time I Got It Wrong</h2><p>Let me tell you about a time when I got this wrong. I was tasked with designing a new feature for our system. I thought I had it all figured out and spent a whole week preparing. I came into the high-level design meeting, diagrams and everything, feeling confident. But then, a few critical questions came up—questions I hadn’t even thought about. My whole design fell apart right there.</p><p>Looking back, if I had designed it twice—if I had taken the time to think of alternatives—I would have been much better prepared. I could have answered those questions or even had a backup design ready. It was a big lesson in how easy it is to overlook important details when you rush with the first idea.</p><h2 id="Why-It-Matters"><a href="#Why-It-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why It Matters"></a>Why It Matters</h2><p>The point is, design isn’t just about getting something to work—it’s about getting it right. The “design it twice” idea helps you avoid bad decisions and spot better solutions. And the best part is, this approach doesn’t take a lot of extra time, but it improves the quality of your designs and sharpens your skills.</p><p>Recently, I summarized this chapter in my Telegram channel, <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">Byte-Sized Tech</a>, where I regularly post summaries of tech books and share interesting blog posts. I started summarizing this book because it’s full of valuable lessons I’ve picked up (sometimes the hard way) over the years.</p><p>This “design it twice” idea really hit home for me. If I had applied it earlier, I could’ve saved myself from some embarrassing moments. So, if you’re like me, trying to improve your design skills, this chapter—and my <a href="https://t.me/booksbytes">channel</a>—might just help you avoid those pitfalls too.</p><p>The next time you’re working on a design, don’t just settle for the first idea. Take the time to come up with alternatives. You’ll make better choices, and you’ll feel a lot more confident walking into that next design meeting.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A big debate among developers is whether to write code for today’s problem or to build a general-purpose solution for future needs. Both approaches have their pros and cons. Specific-purpose code can quickly become messy. But overly general code can add unnecessary complexity. This post, obviously opinionated, argues for a middle ground. That’s the sweet spot, as always.</p><p>We will look at the dangers of overgeneralizing and not generalizing at all through two examples: a shopping cart and a vehicle rental system.</p><h2 id="Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code"><a href="#Shopping-Cart-System-The-Problem-with-Specific-Purpose-Code" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code"></a>Shopping Cart System - The Problem with Specific-Purpose Code</h2><p>Imagine you’re building a shopping cart system, and you need to remove items. A specific-purpose solution might give you a method for each removal task, like this:</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShoppingCart</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveItemById</span>(<span class="params"><span class="built_in">string</span> itemId</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.Id == itemId);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveAllOutOfStockItems</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(item =&gt; item.IsOutOfStock);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">ClearCart</span>()</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        _items.Clear();</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This works fine if your only goals are removing items by ID or clearing the cart. But the problems start to stack up fast:</p><ul><li><p>Cognitive Load: You’re adding a new method for each scenario. As you add features, the class becomes more cluttered. Want to add another removal condition? Get ready to write another method.</p></li><li><p>Shallow Design: Each method does one specific thing. That seems fine until you realize your interface is full of shallow, one-off methods. That makes it hard to maintain and extend.</p></li></ul><p>This approach is good for now. But, it will limit you later. Your code will quickly get out of control.</p><h2 id="Shopping-Cart-System-The-Overly-Bloated-Generic-Solution"><a href="#Shopping-Cart-System-The-Overly-Bloated-Generic-Solution" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Cart System - The Overly Bloated, Generic Solution"></a>Shopping Cart System - The Overly Bloated, Generic Solution</h2><p>To solve this, some devs go too far. They overcomplicate things by making their code too generic. They try to cover every possible scenario, even ones that don’t exist yet.

It removes items, interacts with an external rule service, applies external filters, and triggers callbacks. All this for what should be a simple operation: removing items from a shopping cart.</p></li><li><p>Unnecessary Complexity: You don’t always need to check with external systems or pass in callback functions for simple tasks. When you try to remove an out-of-stock item, you end up with something like:</p></li></ul><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cart.RemoveItems(</span><br><span class="line">    item =&gt; item.IsOutOfStock,</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="literal">null</span>,                  <span class="comment">// No external rule service</span></span><br><span class="line">    items =&gt; items,        <span class="comment">// No external filter</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="literal">null</span>);                 <span class="comment">// No callback</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This is way too much complexity for something that should be straightforward. You don’t want to drag in rules and filters for a simple remove operation. It’s overkill and just adds mental overhead.</p><h2 id="Shopping-Cart-System-The-Balanced-Approach"><a href="#Shopping-Cart-System-The-Balanced-Approach" class="headerlink" title="Shopping Cart System - The Balanced Approach"></a>Shopping Cart System - The Balanced Approach</h2><p>Now let’s find the middle ground. Instead of being too specific or too generic, you build something flexible, simple, and clear.</p><p>Here’s what it looks like:</p><figure class="highlight csharp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ShoppingCart</span></span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">RemoveItems</span>(<span class="params">Func&lt;Item, <span class="built_in">bool</span>&gt; condition</span>)</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="comment">// Remove items from the cart that meet the condition</span></span><br><span class="line">        _items.RemoveAll(condition);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This approach is great because:</p><ul><li>Simplicity: You’re not adding extra methods for every possible removal condition.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>AI is the new bogeyman for software engineers</strong></em>. Every other day, some headline is screaming that AI is coming for our jobs, after all they do the job better, faster and they don’t need these long coffee breaks… If you’ve been losing sleep over these headlines, don’t worry—I’m sure there’s an AI that can help with that too.</p><p>But anyway, here’s the kicker—whether you think you’re replaceable by AI or you think you’re not—you’re right. (Yes, I paraphrased Henry Ford.)</p><p><em><strong>You are a code monkey</strong></em>. Let’s get real. If your job is to make basic CRUD apps, convert specs into code, or change a button’s color, then you should worry. AI is already chomping at the bit to automate the hell out of those tasks. Why? Because they are easy and repetitive.</p><blockquote><p>“Checklist: Are You a Code Monkey?”</p><ul><li><p>Spends 80% of your day renaming variables.</p></li><li><p>Thinks a “challenging task” is updating the color scheme.</p></li><li><p>Believing that creativity is choosing between a ‘for’ loop and a ‘while’ loop.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><em><strong>You are more than a code monkey(?)</strong></em>. AI can do the simple, repetitive stuff.</p><p>I use it daily for many things, for my own day job, and for some personal projects. One thing that is very noticeable is that for some tasks it is great! Queries? awesome, new CRUD for a model? Fantastic! Designing a system? Refactoring legacy code? Debugging difficult issues? Yeah, AI is not so great at that. These tasks need experience, intuition, and creativity. AI lacks these. AI can assist, suggest, give feedback, and automate parts of these tasks, but the heavy lifting? That still needs a human touch.</p><p>So, whether you think you are replaceable by AI or you think you are not—you’re right. If you reduce your work to translating specifications into code, then yes, AI might soon be able to do your job. But <em><strong>if you see yourself as a problem-solver and a critical thinker, you are irreplaceable.</strong></em> </p><hr><p>I hope that ages well, but if the robots take my job anytime soon, I’ll keep you updated.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“The market is tough” is something many juniors hear today. people are frustrated. graduating after 3-4 years with a CS degree is not easy.  They graduate only to find out nobody wants to hire them or even move forward beyond the initial screening.</p><p>I’ll be real with you. there’s a chance you are not enough.</p><p>when I say you might not be enough, I don’t mean it in a “gate-keepy” way. I mean that the way you present yourself right now might not be impressive. that’s good news because you can fix it. it is not necessarily a “cosmetic” change alone, you might need to do more impressive things to present.</p><p>let’s face it, if you graduated from college with a CS degree, without anything impressive to share, most chances you are doomed. the bare minimum doesn’t cut it. there are hundreds of candidates for each junior position.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: although I only explicitly mention CS degrees, the below advice applies to bootcamp grads or self-taught devs… obviously…</p><p>here are the tips make the most sense in that situation</p><ul><li><p>realize you are the problem - prerequisite step. (the company&#x2F;recruiter is not to blame, they didn’t miss out on you because you got an auto rejection, and there are too many candidates)</p></li><li><p>seek feedback &amp; improve resume - there’s a ton of content on how to improve a resume - look it up. also, you can post your resume on linkedin, reddit, etc., and ask to get honest feedback on it.</p></li><li><p>education isn’t enough - do personal projects. explain what you built, what skills you acquired, what challenges you had, and share your code.</p></li><li><p>apply through friends or random people on linkedin that work where you want to apply - DM them.</p></li><li><p>lower your expectations - your first job doesn’t have to be glamorous, or even pay well. get any job as a dev.</p></li><li><p>seek mentorship - find someone who is a few steps ahead of you, and ask for their tailored advice for your specific situation. (I am available for questions, see <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">here</a>).</p></li></ul><hr><p>I applied all these tips myself ~4.5 years ago.</p><p>my first job as a dev was in a lab in the uni I studied in. I got paid minimum wage - but that line on the resume a year later was priceless.</p><hr><blockquote><p>“Well I have been trying all of that for months, and nothing changed - what now?!”</p></blockquote><p>There are two options. you either didn’t apply the advice well enough - seek mentorship.<br>or you just need to lower the bar for the roles you apply for. your first job might not be a dev job. it can be qa, data analyst, or anything else that is close enough to a dev role so that you can make the jump within the company.</p><p>I am not a fan of sugar-coating so I’ll be blunt with you… if you didn’t find a job in 6 months, and you aren’t doing anything about it besides spamming recruiters, most chances it ain’t happening this month too. progress is not achieved passively. figure out your weaknesses and iteratively get better.</p><hr><p>oh, and a few more tips… once you do get a technical interview put emphasis on the following</p><ul><li><p>show you are coachable - you know how to receive feedback and adapt.</p></li><li><p>show your passion - talk about your projects with passion, explain the decisions you had to make, and why you made them.</p></li><li><p>show your skill - code fluently in a single language at the very least. (most companies don’t let you prompt llms in an interview, yet)</p></li></ul><hr><h3 id="How-can-I-try-to-help"><a href="#How-can-I-try-to-help" class="headerlink" title="How can I try to help?"></a>How can I try to help?</h3><ul><li>I am offering free <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">mentorship</a></li><li>I recently developed a <a href="https://github.com/sissues/cli">platform</a> for devs to get better at backend skills through real-world projects.

      <title>SWE laws of power</title>

      <url>/2024/05/11/swe-laws-of-power/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever noticed how some software engineers seem to rocket up the career ladder, while others, just as talented, barely move? It’s not always about how good you are with code; sometimes, it’s about playing the game smartly. This got me thinking when I was reading “The 48 Laws of Power.” It struck me that many of these laws could be specially adapted. So, I chose the 5 laws that I think are most relevant and impactful for software engineers.</p><p>As a side note, the experience of reading the book wasn’t just about entertainment; it helped me see the everyday subtle manipulations we often overlook. But remember, if that’s the game, you can’t hate the players. Although a more honest title for this book might be “48 Laws of Manipulation,” it probably wouldn’t sell as well, because let’s face it—‘power’ sounds a lot more appealing.</p><p>Banter aside, the book does contain some solid tips or laws that go beyond mere manipulation.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>DISCLAIMER:</em></strong>  Rules are made to be broken.</p></blockquote><p>Anyway…</p><h2 id="1-Never-outshine-the-master"><a href="#1-Never-outshine-the-master" class="headerlink" title="1. Never outshine the master"></a>1. Never outshine the master</h2><blockquote><p>Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite—inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.</p></blockquote><p>You are ambitious, you want to get promoted, so you develop something that you think can be very impactful for the company (for example), and you go presenting it to your VP instead of going through your superior first - BAD.</p><p>This kind of thing will make your superior feel undermined and uncomfortable, and it can also reflect on you as someone who does not respect “the chain of command”.</p><p>You’d want to involve your superior, as most likely, they will be the ones that need to drive the process to your promotion - if they think you are trying to undermine them that promo is definitely less likely.</p><h2 id="2-Concentrate-Your-Forces"><a href="#2-Concentrate-Your-Forces" class="headerlink" title="2. Concentrate Your Forces"></a>2. Concentrate Your Forces</h2><blockquote><p>Conserve your forces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting from one shallow mine to another—intensity defeats extensity every time. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to come.</p></blockquote><p>This one’s actually not a manipulation, and a general good tip.<br>In the context of a software engineer that wants to get promoted, I’d say this law is all about, focusing on your goals defined by you and your superior, and about being an expert of a specific technology that the comapny is using - esentially be the “go-to guy&#x2F;girl” for any questions or advice on a specific tech.</p><h2 id="3-Win-through-your-actions-never-through-argument"><a href="#3-Win-through-your-actions-never-through-argument" class="headerlink" title="3. Win through your actions, never through argument"></a>3. Win through your actions, never through argument</h2><blockquote><p>Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not explicate.</p></blockquote><p>Being opinionated is somewhat a part of the job, but you don’t have to get argumentative over every “debate”, choose your battles.<br>After all, you will have to continue working with the team you argue with, and if you are teammed up with people that are less argumentative, you might make them resent you, even (or especially) if you are right (and when they refuse to admit it).</p><p>This rule kinda sucks, as I find good arguments when both sides are not insecure to be very productive, but that’s why you have to choose your battles depending if the topic truly worth arguing about, and the personality of who you will be arguing with… it can do more harm than good, even if you are right (yeah that truly sucks).</p><h2 id="4-Make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless"><a href="#4-Make-your-accomplishments-seem-effortless" class="headerlink" title="4. Make your accomplishments seem effortless"></a>4. Make your accomplishments seem effortless</h2><blockquote><p>Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you work—it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some think exposure to how hard they work and practice demonstrates diligence and honesty, but really it just shows weakness. What is understandable is not awe-inspiring.  The more mystery surrounds your actions, the more awesome your power seems. </p></blockquote><p>This one’s pretty straightforward even in the context of a software engineer, but just for the sake of clearness, here’s an example:</p><blockquote><p>“Wow, how do you manage code-review your teammates so consistently and still be on top of your work?”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Ah that’s nothing, I still work 3 hours a day”</p></blockquote><p>Don’t tell them about your chatgpt automations, no matter what.</p><p>(kind of a joke, but you get the idea)</p><h2 id="5-Always-say-less-than-necessary"><a href="#5-Always-say-less-than-necessary" class="headerlink" title="5. Always say less than necessary"></a>5. Always say less than necessary</h2><blockquote><p>When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.</p></blockquote><p>This can be applied to many things, for example</p><p>When you are in a technical disscusion, try to speak concisely and focus on delivering impactful, well-thought-out comments. Instead of trying to contribute to every topic, with whatever comes to mind. You want to be seen thoughtful and deliberate. (I never appreciated the ones who comment just for the sake of commenting, with something obvious and negligble, don’t be that guy&#x2F;girl.)</p><hr><p>That’s it.<br>I do some <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">mentoring</a> btw.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Weekly releases bad</title>
      <link href="/2024/04/19/weekly-releases-bad/"/>
      <url>/2024/04/19/weekly-releases-bad/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about release schedules. My team had a rollercoaster ride with our release strategy, moving from stressful weekly releases loaded with bugs and merge conflicts to a more smooth (but not perfect), automated releases several times a day. A year later, after too many production incidents, it was decided that we are reverting to weekly releases. It feels like a huge step backward, but let’s unpack this.</p><h2 id="The-Problem"><a href="#The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Problem"></a>The Problem</h2><p>After some serious customer-impacting incidents, management decided to hit the brakes. They think moving back to weekly releases will make our product more stable. From where I’m standing, this feels like fixing a leaking pipe by turning off the water supply — sure, it stops the immediate problem, but isn’t it just a little extreme?</p><p>With daily releases, if something broke, we could fix it fast. Small, manageable updates meant fewer headaches. Now, going back to weekly releases feels like we’re just bundling up problems to deal with all at once.</p><p>Honestly, I don’t think the release is the problem, but our testing coverage.</p><h2 id="The-real-problem"><a href="#The-real-problem" class="headerlink" title="The real problem"></a>The real problem</h2><p>We have e2e and unit tests, and some basic API healthchecks, but it’s clearly not enough. We need a beefier strategy here.<br>What kind of strategy? well I’d start with making a list of all of our core behavior (each team should take care of their own ofc) and make sure we cover all of them (we definitely don’t right now).</p><p><img src="/../weekly-releases-bad/248-unit-tests.png"></p><p>With every new incident that happened, the pattern became more clear… we are sitting in the retro meeting thinking - “oh, we didn’t have any test covering that behavior at all, we should add that” - which is fine in a retrospective sense, but I suggest being proactive about it.</p><p>So rather than slowing down everything, I think we should fix our weaknesses.<br>Sure, weekly releases would mmake the product more stable during the week, but developers experience also matters. and the best devex? you write your code, you have many tests that give you confidence when you push to prod, and you push to prod on a daily basis. everything less than that is a compromise.</p><p>I’d be even up for a codefreeze in the meantime, so we ensure that the testing efforts are tackled and not pushed back to the backlog.</p><h2 id="Counters"><a href="#Counters" class="headerlink" title="Counters"></a>Counters</h2><ul><li><p>writing and running more tests costs more</p><ul><li><p>Yes, building a robust testing environment takes time and money. But think about the cost of not doing it — losing customers, hurting our reputation, and all the stress of fixing things after they’ve gone wrong. I’d argue that investing in better testing could save us a lot in the long run. And once we’ve set it up, maintaining it isn’t as costly as setting it up.</p></li><li><p>weekly releases can also sink a day’s worth of work of a few engineers, on a weekly basis. (which also translates to money)</p></li><li><p>subpar devex can lead to lower devs retention in the org.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>All in all, I think that its a hard decision to make, but I’d argue that in the long term we would have benefited from tests much better than weekly releases.</p><p>To conclude, slowing down to weekly releases might seem like a safe move, but it’s like putting a Band-Aid on a broken arm. What we really need is to strengthen our processes where they’re weak — especially our testing. Let’s not settle for a quick fix that might hold us back in the long run.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Feature flags spaghetti // FFs missing features</title>

      <url>/2024/02/03/feature-flags-missing-features/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Feature flags solutions are pretty established by now, but I feel like there are some key features missing that would make me switch vendors.</p><p>I mainly have two problems with current solutions:</p><ol><li>It can get tedious and messy to turn on&#x2F;off a feature when multiple FFs were placed for it</li><li>Your codebase becomes a FF graveyard if you don’t remember cleaning it, and you probably don’t…</li></ol><p>To solve these issues I have two suggestions:</p><ol><li>FF Trees! I want to be able to create connections between flags. I want to have a main flag (per feature for example), and connect to it different “sub-flags” that control the flow inside different services and the UI.<br>Once I turn on&#x2F;off the main flag I expect all flags to be turned on&#x2F;off accordingly, so that I can easily roll out or rollback an entire feature while changing a single flag.</li></ol><p><img src="/../feature-flags-missing-features/ff_tree.png"></p><p>This is probably an extreme example, but I have had the pleasure to work on projects where I needed to turn on 4-5 FFs in order to test a feature e2e, and it definitely gets messy.</p><blockquote><p>“oh sh*t I missed that one UI FF, that’s why I don’t see anything in the page”<br> -many developers around the world after debugging the feature flags spaghetti in their codebase.</p></blockquote><p>This feels like a natural addition to current solutions IMO - I encourage you to poke holes in it.</p><hr><ol start="2"><li>Send notifications of inactive &#x2F; fully open FFs</li></ol><p>I don’t want to create myself JIRA tickets to remove the FFs checks from the code once the feature is out in the wild just to forget about them months later after the feature was released.</p><p>These dead branches in the code are such a pain… and it makes debugging much harder - I hate it.

      <title>My thoughts on tech debt</title>
      <link href="/2023/12/04/tech-debt-fallacy/"/>
      <url>/2023/12/04/tech-debt-fallacy/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s dive into a straightforward discussion about tech debt. It’s a familiar concept, but often its real impact is misunderstood or overstated. Here’s my  take on it.</p><h2 id="Not-just-a-buzzword"><a href="#Not-just-a-buzzword" class="headerlink" title="Not just a buzzword"></a>Not just a buzzword</h2><p>First off, tech debt isn’t just a buzzword to throw around in meetings. It’s sometimes used as a political tool, with suggestions like “Let’s refactor this” or “We could optimize that” sounding constructive. But we need to ask: are these suggestions truly about improvement (and how?) or just about appearing proactive?</p><h2 id="Creating-a-process-to-evaluate-tech-debt"><a href="#Creating-a-process-to-evaluate-tech-debt" class="headerlink" title="Creating a process to evaluate tech debt"></a>Creating a process to evaluate tech debt</h2><p>We introduced a structured process to evaluate tech debt, I was tired of “tech debt meetings” trying to prioritize raw ideas that were thrown in other meetings. We began asking important questions like, “What value does this add?” or “What’s the severity?”, and “What other teams might be affected?” This approach forced us to think critically about each proposal, moving away from casual suggestions to well-thought-out plans.</p><p>BTW, after introducing that process, tech debt suggestions went down dramatically. No more casual suggestions of refactoring stuff without justification.</p><h2 id="Prioritizing-tech-debt"><a href="#Prioritizing-tech-debt" class="headerlink" title="Prioritizing tech debt"></a>Prioritizing tech debt</h2><p>Consider this scenario: a team member proposed advanced metrics monitoring for a specific service as a tech debt. It was an intriguing idea, but not what we needed most. Our actual need was more tests for that service (which almost didn’t have any) – not as glamorous as new metrics, but far more critical. This illustrates that tech debt is about prioritizing necessities over nice-to-haves.</p><p>“I think that if I add some monitoring to that service and put it on a cute dashboard, I can show it off to the rest of the department and maybe it will help me getting promoted” - No. tech debt isn’t necessarily what you want to work on. It’s probably the exact opposite.</p><p>Now, about those “tech debt &#x2F; quality weeks.” If a task is genuinely critical, it shouldn’t wait for a special week. It should be part of our regular workflow. If you believe that tech debt tasks won’t get prioritized unless you have special weeks for them, it just means that these tasms are not that important.</p><hr><p>In conclusion, tech debt should be about strategic improvements that align with our main goals, not chasing the latest trends or personal preferences. It’s about impactful changes that enhance our systems and make our work more efficient. Let’s keep our focus sharp and our priorities clear.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, the path to growth is paved with missteps. Recently, I faced one such bend in the road - an opportunity to lead a major feature, something I’d been eyeing for a while. In my eagerness to shine, to be seen as ‘promotion-worthy’ and ‘intelligent,’ I stumbled.<br>This post goes beyond just telling the story of my stumble; it’s about digging into the lessons that came out of it.</p><p>I find immense value, especially as the writer, in sharing these experiences. Writing about them not only cements my learnings but also, I hope, encourages you to reflect on and share your own mistakes and lessons learned.</p><h2 id="Heavy-weight-feature"><a href="#Heavy-weight-feature" class="headerlink" title="Heavy-weight feature"></a>Heavy-weight feature</h2><p>As a software engineer eagerly awaiting a promotion, I’ve felt ready to step up for some time. However, management needed more evidence of my leadership capabilities, particularly in steering a larger-scale feature than I had previously managed.</p><blockquote><p>Note - leading a feature in this specific company was pretty broad. you get some raw product requirements, design the architecture for the solution, &gt;iterate with the product on the specs, and break down the feature into small tasks for multiple teams to handle, while implementing the core parts and syncing with everyone involved on a weekly&#x2F;bi-weekly basis to verify everyone’s on track. </p><p>TLDR; It is a pretty demanding task.</p></blockquote><p>The scope of the feature I got was the biggest I ever got, and it was even more important since it was linked to my promotion - doing well leading that feature meant getting promoted in the next cycle.</p><h2 id="Blunder"><a href="#Blunder" class="headerlink" title="Blunder"></a>Blunder</h2><p>Since the feature was so important to me, I mistakingly tried to do everything on my own without consulting with other engineers, thinking that it would make me stand out.<br>I came to the design review meeting, fully prepared, ready to shower everyone with my great solution - eager for them to just say “Awesome, let’s do that”.<br>I didn’t even come up with an alternative. I was so laser-focused on my design, that I was blinded by it.</p><p>10 minutes into the meeting, one of the principal engineers asked a question that I didn’t consider. In the following 10 minutes, everyone in the meeting (including me) decides that the design could and should be improved.</p><h2 id="Handling-disappointment"><a href="#Handling-disappointment" class="headerlink" title="Handling disappointment"></a>Handling disappointment</h2><p>I prepared for that design review meeting for a week. I thought I did good enough research. and then within 10 minutes of the meeting, most of my design went to trash.</p><p>It was a shock to me since I never failed so publicly, I just grabbed some water and left the office. It was a bad day.</p><p>It was also hard since I felt my perceived intelligence took a blow that day. I was never pushed back like that and felt pretty confused as to how I missed all of it while I was planning and designing for a week.</p><p>Instead of dwelling in disappointment, the day after the design review meeting I started jotting down the new design, this time having separate calls with multiple engineers brainstorming for potential flaws and overall correctness of the new approach.</p><p>A week later, I presented my revised design. The second review meeting was a stark contrast to the first. Not only was my design well-received, but I also felt a renewed sense of confidence. This wasn’t just about the approval of the design; it was a testament to my ability to learn, adapt, and grow from my experiences.</p><h2 id="What-I-learned"><a href="#What-I-learned" class="headerlink" title="What I learned"></a>What I learned</h2><ul><li>I will fail more often than I want - that’s a good thing, I want to be challenged as much as possible! I felt I had grown a lot from this particular failure.</li><li>Asking for advice and brainstorming sessions while designing a feature doesn’t mean you take less credit for it.</li><li>Deadlines vs Feelings - even though I felt really bad after that first design review meeting, I didn’t let that affect the day after and I started working on the new design immediately. This was key to recovering mentally, and to also showcase that failures don’t get me too rattled.</li></ul><p>In my quest to stand out, I initially believed that going solo was the key to earning full credit and proving my worth. I thought that handling everything independently would showcase my capabilities most convincingly. However, this experience taught me that this mindset was far from the truth.</p><p>Observing engineers whom I admire, those several levels above with decades more experience, I noticed something crucial: they didn’t shy away from collaboration, even on high-stakes projects. They regularly sought input and brainstormed with others, including those less experienced, like myself. This was an eye-opener.</p><p>I realized that it’s not about taking all the credit; it’s about creating the best outcome through shared efforts and diverse perspectives.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Advice for junior software engineers</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four years in software engineering taught me a lot but not what I expected. I thought nailing the code would nail the promotions, but that was a rookie mistake. Most juniors suck at the real skills you need to climb up - it ain’t just about the code, and yes, that threw me too. It’s a wild ride in the startup and corporate world, and shifting your mindset is crucial.</p><p>In this post, I will be drawing from my own experience, trying to describe the new mindset you have to adopt.</p><h2 id="What-do-companies-expect-of-a-junior"><a href="#What-do-companies-expect-of-a-junior" class="headerlink" title="What do companies expect of a junior?"></a>What do companies expect of a junior?</h2><p>In short, the expectation is - to get a detailed, and relatively narrow task and be able to execute well on it in a reasonable time (probably with help from your team).</p><p>Let’s break it down.</p><ul><li><p><em><strong>“detailed, and relatively narrow task”</strong></em> - you won’t be writing a completely new feature. the mental work of designing the feature was already done by one of your colleagues. and you will be executing on a small, well-defined piece of it.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>“Execute well on it”</strong></em> - this may sound obvious, but the expectation here is writing a simple solution to the task. the solution should answer the requirements and be well-tested.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>“in reasonable time”</strong></em> - when you get assigned the task, most probably you will be asked to give an estimate. since you might be new to the project someone else might estimate it for you, while accounting for your unfamiliarity with the project.<br>In my book, a reasonable time is anything less than 2x the estimate for a new junior hire.<br>There’s a nuance here. estimates are by definition only an estimation. many times when engineers of different levels estimate their work it is inaccurate - and if you feel that you are not making the imaginary estimation deadline, it is important to communicate it to your team lead.</p></li></ul><p>To wrap up this section, you should understand that the expectations from you as a junior are much different than mid-level, or senior.<br>You are expected to have inaccurate estimations, struggle with learning the codebase, and ask tons of questions.<br>Embrace this. don’t be shy. ask questions, let yourself be the <em><strong>“dumbest”</strong></em> in the team, and learn as much as you can.<br>Early in your career, you should adopt a mentality of <em><strong>“I know nothing, please teach me”</strong></em>.<br>It might be challenging to adopt since we all have egos, but I believe that if you want to get out of the junior phase quickly, you have to realize that they hired you as a junior for a reason, and you probably have a lot to learn from your co-workers.</p><h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>This one is relevant to software engineers at all levels.<br>Ask your team lead&#x2F;seniors for feedback on your performance.<br>Make sure you are given feedback regularly, and not only once a year in a performance review.</p><p>Accepting feedback is also a skill you have to work on, as your instinct might be to defend yourself upon receiving some bad feedback.<br>Listen to the feedback, take notes if necessary, and ask for clarifications.<br><em><strong>This is not a fight</strong></em> where your team lead is bashing you and you are defending yourself.<br>This is a discussion on how you can do better, embrace it, and <em><strong>be vulnerable</strong></em> so that you’ll be able to grow from it.</p><p>Asking for feedback will also make people around you perceive you as one who is looking to grow, which is a great place to start if you want to get promoted eventually.</p><h2 id="Promotion"><a href="#Promotion" class="headerlink" title="Promotion"></a>Promotion</h2><p><em><strong>If you don’t ask for it - you don’t get it.</strong></em></p><p>“He is writing such clean code consistently, I think we should promote him” - said no one, ever.</p><p>If you want to get promoted you have to communicate it, and <em><strong>you have to ask for it</strong></em>, no one will magically do it for you (in most cases).</p><p><em><strong>Don’t guess what it takes to be a mid-level &#x2F; senior - ask</strong></em><br>Don’t rely on the definitions you find online of a mid-level or a senior engineer.<br>Ask your team lead: <em><strong>“I am aiming for a promotion this year, what are the gaps between my current level and the next one?”</strong></em></p><p>This accomplishes two things:</p><ul><li>Your team lead now knows you want to be promoted</li><li>After the conversation you will know better what you need to do to match the criteria in your specific company.</li></ul><p>I have a few more important pieces of advice about getting promoted I wanted to mention:</p><ul><li>Pay attention to <em><strong>how often people are getting promoted</strong></em>, what did they do? learn from others around you, and ask them for advice.</li><li><em><strong>Have your team lead promoted anyone before?</strong></em> If they did, great - it raises your confidence that they can pull it off, but if that never happened it might raise a few red flags about your team lead or team itself - you might need to switch jobs to get promoted.</li><li>Define <em><strong>clear and measurable goals</strong></em> with your team lead, so that by achieving them it is much easier for him to push for your promotion.</li></ul><p>Another aspect of being promoted as a junior is how people perceive you.<br>You’ll have to work hard to make your surroundings perceive you as someone who is not “the junior” or “the intern”.<br>Sometimes, it is just easier to switch jobs, aiming for the next level.</p><h2 id="Mentorship-getting-personalized-advice"><a href="#Mentorship-getting-personalized-advice" class="headerlink" title="Mentorship - getting personalized advice"></a>Mentorship - getting personalized advice</h2><p><em><strong>It is hard writing advice for all juniors, in all countries and all companies.</strong></em><br>Much of the things I said are very general, and having a mentor who knows your story personally and gives you personalized advice, is super powerful.<br>Seek a mentor (within or outside your company) that you are comfortable talking to and being vulnerable with, it can boost your career.</p><hr><p>On that note, <em><strong>I am offering some mentorship myself</strong></em>.<br>If you read this post, I hope you get the impression that I love guiding others in their journey.<br>If you want to talk to me and get some more <em><strong>personalized advice</strong></em> just contact me via <a href="mailto:eliran9692@gmail.com">Email</a> &#x2F; <a href="https://twitter.com/_eltur">Twitter</a> &#x2F; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliran-turgeman/">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>If you want some more details about what I offer as a mentor, check out <a href="https://www.16elt.com/mentorship/">this page</a></p><hr><h2 id="Common-reactions-of-juniors"><a href="#Common-reactions-of-juniors" class="headerlink" title="Common reactions of juniors"></a>Common reactions of juniors</h2><ul><li>I feel uncomfortable asking for feedback &#x2F; I don’t know how</li><li>I feel uncomfortable asking for a raise, or a promotion &#x2F; I don’t know how</li><li>I don’t know how to “market” myself</li></ul><p>For some time, I am the guy that is pushing my colleagues into having such conversations with their team lead.<br>Being a junior is synonym to having the above excuses (in most cases).<br>To climb up, you need to break free of them, and unlearn a few things.</p><p>Anyhow, this is my take that sums everything up -<br><em><strong>A job is a deal you are making with a company where you are selling your time. If you value it, make the most of it.</strong></em></p><h2 id="What-else"><a href="#What-else" class="headerlink" title="What else?"></a>What else?</h2><p>There’s much more things to cover, and I might cover them in a follow-up post. things like:</p><ul><li>Handling failures &amp; dissapointments (while staying professional)</li><li>Managing your time well (how not to work 12h a day)</li><li>Pushing technical initiatives</li><li>Getting the most out of compensation talks</li></ul><p>etc…</p><p>Anyhow, this is it for today.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a blog post that at some point might get turned into a series.</p><p>In this potential series, I want to take a look at different stops on my journey to software engineering and elaborate on my struggles, wins, losses, and what I learned along the way.</p><h2 id="Motivation-to-find-a-job-empty-wallet"><a href="#Motivation-to-find-a-job-empty-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Motivation to find a job - empty wallet"></a>Motivation to find a job - empty wallet</h2><p>This part of the story begins in the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.<br>How did I get there? well, that’s a different part of the story, which I might expand on in a separate post.</p><p>So my first year is done, and I am headed into the summer break!<br>It is supposed to be the most worry-free part of the year, but I do have one worry… I have no money.</p><p>In Israel, education isn’t as expensive as in the US but still, for someone who was recently released from the army after 3 years (totally different story…), paying University tuition isn’t easy.</p><p>During my first year, I took part in a paid scholarship, where I was teaching Math to high school girls.<br>It paid my dorm rent and food, and everything else was more or less a luxury.<br>That meant that I didn’t have money saved up to pay the tuition at the beginning of the second year. Well then, it is time to find a job.</p><h2 id="The-dream-of-big-tech"><a href="#The-dream-of-big-tech" class="headerlink" title="The dream of big-tech"></a>The dream of big-tech</h2><p>In the summer break between my first and second year, I understood I had to get a job to survive the upcoming year’s expenses.<br>Usually, computer science students try to get an internship after finishing data structure &amp; algorithms courses, but I didn’t have that luxury, I needed to find a job much faster than that.</p><p>Trying to write my first resume I looked up many tips on how to stand out considering my position, and one advice that kept popping up is to have some projects you did on your outside of Uni classes.</p><p>Uni mostly taught me to write in C, and C++ (which was cool), but for my projects I also wanted to learn a new language and say  “I learned that language on my own, I can learn whatever language you are working with!”<br>With that realization, I taught myself Python. I spent the entire summer break, watching tutorials, and coding projects from sunrise to sunset.<br>I had one goal in mind, and it was to get an internship as early as possible.</p><p>By the beginning of the second year, I had my resume ready, including my new Python projects. I thought I had a good chance.<br>I started applying to whatever internship&#x2F;junior position I saw on LinkedIn.</p><p>Got a few interviews, even with big names like Microsoft and Intel, but I didn’t pass any of those.</p><h2 id="Handling-disappointment"><a href="#Handling-disappointment" class="headerlink" title="Handling disappointment"></a>Handling disappointment</h2><p>I was super down each time I got rejected.<br>The imposter syndrome starts manifesting, you start feeling like “Maybe I am not as smart and talented as I thought I was”.<br>At the same time, I am constantly reminding myself “If you fail this, you might need to be a waiter or whatever”.<br>I put a lot of stress on myself, I didn’t take these rejections well, though I didn’t show it outwards.</p><p>For a month I tried to apply to more positions, and no luck. till one morning, on the student’s Facebook group, a Ph.D. doctorate posted that she was looking for a developer for her biology research lab.</p><p>I jumped on the opportunity. It was less glamorous than a big-tech job, but at this point, I am not fighting for glamour, I am fighting for not getting into debt.</p><h2 id="I-am-a-software-developer-now"><a href="#I-am-a-software-developer-now" class="headerlink" title="I am a software developer now."></a>I am a software developer now.</h2><p>I got a job at the research lab. there was a small team of around 5 developers and around 5 more researchers.</p><p>The thing I was most proud of, was that I was able to get the job and be effective in it on the language that I self-taught myself over the summer.</p><p>All the earlier disappointments didn’t matter, I had somebody acknowledging my ability to self-study and be effective, and that’s empowering.</p><p>I ended up working there for around 1.5 years, and although it didn’t teach me how to manage in a global team environment, with a complex distributed system I did learn quite a lot at this time.</p><p>It helped me focus on the basics.<br>You get a task -&gt; you think it through -&gt; you code your solution.</p><p>I feel like converting your thoughts to code is a big gap graduates sometimes struggle with, and I believe that working on this basic skill is super important. Interviewers can smell that you can’t code, and as a junior, this is what they hire you for, so make sure you can code well!</p><h2 id="Summarizing"><a href="#Summarizing" class="headerlink" title="Summarizing"></a>Summarizing</h2><p>In my early days as a software engineering student at the Technion, I felt the weight of financial pressure. This led me on a quest for a job, with dreams of joining big tech names. </p><p>Rejections came, but they taught me resilience and adaptability. My decision to self-learn Python eventually landed me a role in a biology research lab. It might not have been the glamorous tech gig I initially envisioned, but it was a powerful testament to my self-driven learning journey. </p><p>Most importantly, this experience highlighted the essence of turning academic knowledge into practical application. My journey, filled with its ups and downs, taught me the invaluable lessons of persistence, adaptability, and the magic of finding opportunities in the most unexpected places.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.16elt.com/2023/07/12/aws-lambda-pitfalls/">AWS Lambda bad practices</a>, and one of them was a bit more personal for me than the others.</p><p>In that post, I talked about how lambda should be idempotent because there’s no guarantee an event will be sent out only once in some cases.</p><p>This is the story about how violating this practice can cause horrible bugs which take days to reproduce and make sense of.</p><p>I’ll go over the issue itself, and how I managed to debug it in non-standard ways, but first you will need some context of the system we are working on.</p><hr><h4 id="Alignment"><a href="#Alignment" class="headerlink" title="Alignment"></a>Alignment</h4><p>Idempotency is a trait of an operation.<br>An idempotent operation is an operation that, if applied multiple times, doesn’t change the result beyond the first result.</p><p>To illustrate, the bellow addition function is idempotent.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> (a, b):</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">return</span> a + b</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And the following is an example of a function which is not idempotent.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">add_one</span>(<span class="params">num</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> num + <span class="number">1</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Application-Introduction"><a href="#Application-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Application Introduction"></a>Application Introduction</h2><p>The application has 3 important parts - The UI, S3, and Lambda.<br>In S3, we have an object which stores metadata about an item.<br>The object is of the following structure.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  objectId: &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    property1: ...,</span><br><span class="line">    property2: ...,</span><br><span class="line">    ...</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">  ...</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The lambda was partly responsible for transforming that metadata object, and the UI was consuming it and rendering the metadata properties of an item.</p><p><img src="/../idempotency-aws-lambda/idempotency-lambda-flow.webp"></p><p>There’s just a single complication - the object ids we used as keys for the metadata object had two formats.</p><p>Essentially, each item had an id coming from a downstream package we developed, and another id that we showed in the UI.</p><p>Meaning that there was a mapping between these different id formats, and the lambda was responsible for transforming the metadata object to contain the UI-compatible ids.</p><p><img src="/../idempotency-aws-lambda/idempotency-lambda-transformation.webp"></p><h2 id="The-Nasty-Bug"><a href="#The-Nasty-Bug" class="headerlink" title="The Nasty Bug"></a>The Nasty Bug</h2><p>It was a chill morning, before I got tagged on that massive Slack thread, and asked to take a look at a weird behavior in production.</p><p>I know that area well, I thought, one hour and I am back to doing whatever I was doing before, calmly.</p><p>Little did I know, I was about to spend a few days solving it.</p><p>The Bug: Users have complained that some of their items don’t have any metadata.</p><p>Well, there’s one S3 object and a single lambda that can be responsible for that, or so I thought.<br>I looked around, no recent code changes, the code that does the transformation isn’t new, it was always working, why would it break now out of nowhere?</p><h2 id="Debugging"><a href="#Debugging" class="headerlink" title="Debugging"></a>Debugging</h2><p>At that point, I have to say that I haven’t even considered idempotency to be the reason for that bug - so I was looking for other places in the flow that might have changed the same object.</p><p>The problem? that’s the flow (roughly)</p><p><img src="/../idempotency-aws-lambda/idempotency-lambda-debugging-flow.webp"></p><p>Essentially, between creating the metadata object in the downstream package, and transforming it in the lambda, there were tons of other lambdas that were invoked.</p><p>I started looking for all the lambdas in the middle that had access to that S3 object, it didn’t minimize the search pool by much, so I started diving into the code, looking for any puts or posts for S3.</p><p>I did that for a few lambdas until I realized it is going to take too long. I have to find a faster way to understand who’s responsible for changing that object.</p><h2 id="Debugging-2-0"><a href="#Debugging-2-0" class="headerlink" title="Debugging 2.0"></a>Debugging 2.0</h2><p>After spending a day trying to reproduce or make some sense of the issue, I haven’t made any real progress.</p><p>Instead of me looking for lambdas that might have changed the object in S3, I figured that S3 can just tell me which lambda changed the object via S3 notifications.</p><p>I set up an S3 notification for objects created events and applied filtering by prefix and suffix so that the event match exactly the object I looked for.<br>I created an SQS which will receive these notifications from S3 and that was it!</p><p>With that setup ready, I triggered the flow, hopeful that I am close to solving this, then I saw a surprising result.</p><p>A few messages arrived in the queue, where I was expecting only one. Each message contained the IAM role name of the lambda that had modified the S3 object.</p><p>I opened these events, first access - S3 object modified from the transformation lambda - 50KB size</p><p>second access - S3 object modified from the transformation the transformation lambda (once again!!) - 0KB size.</p><blockquote><p>“WTF?”</p></blockquote><h2 id="Idempotency-is-Important"><a href="#Idempotency-is-Important" class="headerlink" title="Idempotency is Important"></a>Idempotency is Important</h2><p>Realizing the same lambda was invoked twice with the same event, focused my attention on the function inside that lambda that is doing the id translation.</p><p>After reading the function, everything made sense, this function was clearly not idempotent, and calling it twice would result in an empty object - which explains why the S3 object size was 0KB after the second access, and why there were missing metadata in the UI!</p><p>To illustrat this in code, the translation function was equivalent to the following function.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">transform_keys</span>(<span class="params">mapping, obj</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    transformed = &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">for</span> key <span class="keyword">in</span> obj.keys():</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> key <span class="keyword">in</span> mapping:</span><br><span class="line">            transformed[mapping[key]] = obj[key]</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> transformed</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Assuming the following mapping</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mapping = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;id_format_1_1&quot;: &quot;id_format_2_1&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;id_format_1_2&quot;: &quot;id_format_2_2&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And the below object</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">obj = &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;id_format_1_1&quot;: &quot;value1&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">    &quot;id_format_1_2&quot;: &quot;value2&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Then let’s execute the following.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">transformed_once = transform_keys(mapping, obj)</span><br><span class="line">transformed_twice = transform_keys(mapping, transformed_once)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">f&quot;Transformed once result: <span class="subst">&#123;transformed_once&#125;</span>&quot;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">print</span>(<span class="string">f&quot;Transformed twice result: <span class="subst">&#123;transformed_twice&#125;</span>&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And the results are already known.</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Transformed once result: &#123;&#x27;id_format_2_1&#x27;: &#x27;value1&#x27;, &#x27;id_format_2_2&#x27;: &#x27;value2&#x27;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">Transformed twice result: &#123;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><hr><p>At this point, it was pretty straightforward to find the correct fix and call it a day, the bug is solved.</p><h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>Just to be technically accurate, usually when you are referring to the idempotency principle in lambdas you wary of the possibility that an event will be passed more than once, and it is a pretty random event.</p><p>In our case, there was a different issue in our system that led the event to arrive twice at the lambda consistently.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Idempotency is a real concern, debugging related issues is difficult, and you should design your function to be idempotent from the get-go.</p><p>Personally, I feel like solving this bug matured me as an engineer since I had to be more resourceful than usual with my debugging skills.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently changed teams in the company I am working for, and I was pleased to learn that once in 2 weeks, a member of the team had to come up with a tech-related topic and give a talk about to the rest of the team.</p><p>I took that opportunity, and decided to talk about all of the different ways we suck (PC equivalent is “can improve”) at writing a lambda-based application and suggested some action items (that obviously went for the backlog for some time to chill).</p><p>Nonetheless, I think there’s a great value in fixing these bad practices, as they affect real metrics such as cost and performance, and the developers will to live.</p><p>Anyway, let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="Pitfall-1-Lambda-Monolith"><a href="#Pitfall-1-Lambda-Monolith" class="headerlink" title="Pitfall #1: Lambda Monolith"></a>Pitfall #1: Lambda Monolith</h2><p>I put it first, since that’s the one pattern I have the strongest feelings for (hate in simple terms). Making lambda monoliths is so easy and tempting but the results are truly hideous.</p><p>What is a lambda monolith? Imagine a lambda that can be invoked with different types of events and do different things depending on the event.</p><p>Each event has its own handler, and there’s a mapping between the event type and the handler.</p><p><img src="/../aws-lambda-pitfalls/lambda-monolith.png"></p><p>Besides the known disadvantages of using a monolithic architecture, there are more disadvantages to consider when talking about a lambda monolith.</p><h3 id="Overly-Privileged-Lambdas"><a href="#Overly-Privileged-Lambdas" class="headerlink" title="Overly Privileged Lambdas"></a>Overly Privileged Lambdas</h3><p>In AWS, you manage permissions via IAM roles, and it’s a best practice to give the least number of permissions to a service in order for it to function.</p><p>In case of a lambda monolith, it might be harder to follow that practice, since for example, action #1 might only require S3 access, while action #2 only require RDS access.<br>In that case, the lambda monolith, will have both S3 and RDS access permissions.</p><p>The larger the permission set, the bigger the attack surface is.</p><h3 id="Cold-Start-amp-Deployments"><a href="#Cold-Start-amp-Deployments" class="headerlink" title="Cold Start &amp; Deployments"></a>Cold Start &amp; Deployments</h3><p>The bigger the lambda monolith, the longer it takes to cold-start, and to deploy new versions.</p><h3 id="Memory-Configurations"><a href="#Memory-Configurations" class="headerlink" title="Memory Configurations"></a>Memory Configurations</h3><p>When creating a lambda, you have to specify how much memory it should have, and the more memory it has, the bigger the price per 1ms of execution.</p><p>Imagine a scenario where action #1 is fairly simple and doesn’t require much memory, so you go with the lowest tier.<br>The problem is, action #2 is memory consuming and consistently getting OOM (Out of Memory) errors, so you bump the memory configuration - resulting in higher costs for all different actions in your lambda monolith.</p><p>This can drastically affect your lambda costs, depending on the action that is the most memory consuming.</p><h3 id="Monitoring-amp-Debugging"><a href="#Monitoring-amp-Debugging" class="headerlink" title="Monitoring &amp; Debugging"></a>Monitoring &amp; Debugging</h3><p>Since you have one big lambda monolith, it is harder to understand what kind of action failed when the lambda reports a failure.</p><p>You don’t get granular monitoring OOTB (out of the box) per action, but per lambda. meaning that if you want to see the number of invocations and execution time of your lambda it will be aggregated across all of the different actions, and it will be harder to understand the specific metric properties per action (which is far more valuable).</p><p>Of course, you can try and use your monitoring &amp; tracing tool SDK in order to create some sort of a label for each action, but come on, it shouldn’t be that hard.</p><h3 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h3><p>The only solution here is to separate the lambda monolith into multiple lambdas using the strangler pattern. have one event type, and one action per lambda.</p><p>This is not only a good practice to make your software “cleaner”, but also has real effects on your lambda performance and cost.</p><h2 id="Pitfall-2-Lambdas-Calling-Lambdas"><a href="#Pitfall-2-Lambdas-Calling-Lambdas" class="headerlink" title="Pitfall #2: Lambdas Calling Lambdas"></a>Pitfall #2: Lambdas Calling Lambdas</h2><p>To emphasize, the real problem happens when a lambda is synchronously calling another lambda, and essentially waits for its result in order to continue its own execution.</p><p>Let’s look at an example from AWS documentation.</p><p><img src="/../aws-lambda-pitfalls/lambda-call-lambda.webp"></p><p>In the above example, the lambda responsible for creating the order synchronously calls the process payment lambda, which synchronously calls a create invoice lambda.</p><p>This flow is perfectly fine in a single application on a server, but for a distributed serverless architecture there are a few problems to consider.</p><h3 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h3><p>With lambda, you pay for execution duration, every additional 1ms of invocation duration means a bigger bill.</p><p>The problem with the above pattern, is that when the create order lambda is waiting for the process payment lambda response, you are paying for the execution time of both, and the same goes for the create invoice lambda - the waiting time for a response also counts for the bills even though the waiting lambda didn’t do work.</p><h3 id="Bottleneck"><a href="#Bottleneck" class="headerlink" title="Bottleneck"></a>Bottleneck</h3><p>When using this pattern, the slowest task, like processing payments, can hold up the entire workflow, including faster tasks like creating invoices.</p><h3 id="Error-Handling"><a href="#Error-Handling" class="headerlink" title="Error Handling"></a>Error Handling</h3><p>Since the lambdas are calling each other, all error handling &amp; retries should be handled by each caller lambda.</p><h3 id="Solution-1"><a href="#Solution-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h3><p>According to AWS docs, there are two ways to overcome this pattern.<br>One is by using SQS between the lambda functions, that way we decouple the lambdas so that they don’t become a bottleneck for each other, while also reducing the costs.</p><p>Another approach would be to use Step Functions, which a is a serverless orchestration service that can robustly handle the errors and retries of the lambdas.</p><p>That way the lambda can contain only the business logic.</p><p>It is also common to combine between the approaches, and have a Step Function orchestrating the workflow, that includes SQS between lambdas.</p><h2 id="Pitfall-3-Idempotency"><a href="#Pitfall-3-Idempotency" class="headerlink" title="Pitfall #3: Idempotency"></a>Pitfall #3: Idempotency</h2><p>One of the design principles of Lambda is idempotency. This means that receiving the same event multiple times does not change the result beyond the first time the event was received.</p><p>Since there’s no guarantee that the same event will be sent only once to a lambda, it is critical that you design your function to be idempotent.</p><p>Let’s take a simple example of a lambda, which is responsible for adding users to your DynamoDB table. Given a username and id, your lambda adds it to the Users table, as follows.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> boto3</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">dynamodb = boto3.resource(<span class="string">&#x27;dynamodb&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">table = dynamodb.Table(<span class="string">&#x27;Users&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">lambda_handler</span>(<span class="params">event, context</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    user_id = event[<span class="string">&#x27;user_id&#x27;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">    user_name = event[<span class="string">&#x27;user_name&#x27;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    table.put_item(</span><br><span class="line">        Item=&#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="string">&#x27;UserId&#x27;</span>: user_id,</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="string">&#x27;UserName&#x27;</span>: user_name</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    )</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The problem here is that if the same event goes into the lambda twice, you will have data duplication in your DynamoDB table.</p><p>To fix it, you’d change your code as follows.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">lambda_handler</span>(<span class="params">event, context</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    user_id = event[<span class="string">&#x27;user_id&#x27;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">    user_name = event[<span class="string">&#x27;user_name&#x27;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    table.put_item(</span><br><span class="line">        Item=&#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="string">&#x27;UserId&#x27;</span>: user_id,</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="string">&#x27;UserName&#x27;</span>: user_name</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;,</span><br><span class="line">        ConditionExpression=<span class="string">&#x27;attribute_not_exists(UserId)&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line">    )</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>That was a pretty simple example, and it might not seem critical if in that case there’s data duplication, but I think that if you take a close look at your systems, you will find multiple places where idempotency is critical, so make sure you design for its.</p><hr><p>Anyway, these are 3 pitfalls I often encounter in lambda-based applications, obviously there are more, and I will leave some links for further reading in the references section.</p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/anti-patterns.html">Anti-patterns in Lambda-based applications - AWS Lambda (amazon.com)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/handling-lambda-functions-idempotency-with-aws-lambda-powertools/">Handling Lambda functions idempotency with AWS Lambda Powertools | AWS Compute Blog (amazon.com)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/design-principles.html">Design principles - AWS Lambda (amazon.com)</a></p></li></ul><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No matter what kind of software you’re developing, you most definitely leverage logging to some extent, probably every single day.<br>You write a lot of logs, you read tons of them too, it is the most basic observability tool we have.  </p><h1 id="Not-all-logs-are-equal-x2F-Should-you-even-log-it"><a href="#Not-all-logs-are-equal-x2F-Should-you-even-log-it" class="headerlink" title="Not all logs are equal &#x2F; Should you even log it?"></a>Not all logs are equal &#x2F; Should you even log it?</h1><p>There are many pitfall that can lead to useless, wasteful and confusing logs. Therefore I follow a specific set of practices which allows me to write better logs while also being consistent across the system.<br>You should remmember that logging is for the developers, you are going to be the only one who’s reading them, so as you are about to log something, ask yourself this:</p><ul><li>Is this log really needed? does it rely important information I couldn’t get from the other logs in the same flow? </li><li>Am I going to log an object that can be huge on production? If so, can I just log a few metrics of that objects instead? for example, it’s length, or handpick a few important attribute to log.</li><li>Does the information I am about to log will help me to debug&#x2F;understand the flow?</li></ul><p>These questions should guide you to decide whether you should log something or not, but it’s not the whole story.<br>Given that you decided you should, now you should ask yourself “how?”.  </p><h1 id="How-to-log-it"><a href="#How-to-log-it" class="headerlink" title="How to log it?"></a>How to log it?</h1><p>As a first, and surprisingly not-so-obvious, rule of thumb I’d say you should keep your logs consistent across the system.<br>Consistency leads to predictability which leads to you looking for logs without always having to look how they are defined.<br>For example, If you always start your log with a prefix <code>&quot;[serviceName](functionName)...&quot;</code>, when you are looking for a function log, you don’t have to open up the source code and check out the log message, but maybe I am portraying a bit of utopian world. In any case, consistency is awesome, so keep it.  </p><p>Although consistency is awesome, it doesn’t cut it alone, as your logs can be consistenly trash, so here are a handful of practices I follow when logging.</p><h2 id="Log-levels"><a href="#Log-levels" class="headerlink" title="Log levels"></a>Log levels</h2><p>Whenever you write a log, it’s important you choose the correct log level.<br>I personally mostly use ERROR, WARNING, INFO, or DEBUG (yes there are a few more).</p><h3 id="Log-levels-TLDR"><a href="#Log-levels-TLDR" class="headerlink" title="Log levels TLDR"></a>Log levels TLDR</h3><ul><li>ERROR: Parts of the flow failed, we want to send alerts to our on-call for this failures.</li><li>WARNING: Doesn’t necessarily point to a failure, but an unexpected behavior that should be investigated.</li><li>INFO: Record major events in the flow to help the developer reading it understand what was being executed.</li><li>DEBUG: Like INFO but more detailed, including inspection into objects, data structures, etc.</li></ul><p>The most common pitfalls I see here are logging too detailed info logs, or not using DEBUG at all.</p><h2 id="Log-frugality"><a href="#Log-frugality" class="headerlink" title="Log frugality"></a>Log frugality</h2><p>Whatever service you are using for logging, it costs money, and a fast way to burn money is to log the entire json object that was relatively small on your dev env, but blew up on production.</p><p>Huge object logs are not helpful, it’s hard to read through them.<br>Huge object logs are there because it is easier to throw in everything instead of thinking what would be the most important&#x2F;useful attributes to log.<br>Huge object logs will cost you a lot of money, depending on your scale.  </p><p>Let’s take AWS CloudWatch service for example, currently the price for log ingestion is $0.5 per GB. You log that giant json for all your 1000 customers each time the flow is invoked, you are already paying for that json log alone a few thousands a month. </p><h3 id="What-you-should-do-instead"><a href="#What-you-should-do-instead" class="headerlink" title="What you should do instead?"></a>What you should do instead?</h3><ul><li>Pick the attributes that are the most important and useful to log, the attributes that will actually help you debug the continuation of the flow.</li><li>Sometimes, you just need to know if the object is empty or not, just log that - not the entire object.</li></ul><h2 id="Log-uniqueness"><a href="#Log-uniqueness" class="headerlink" title="Log uniqueness"></a>Log uniqueness</h2><p>Each log message in the system should be unique.<br>If I query for a log in a specfic service, I will be confused to see the exact same logs at different flows inside the service.<br>More than that, I’ll just have to start debugging for the issue, since the logs are now offically useless.  </p><p>One way to keep the logs unique is to denote the service name and function name as a prefix for the log, if you do that - you are guarenteed uniqueness or at the very least, you narrowed the scope of log duplication from the entire service to just a function. </p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Logging is important, it is a crucial tool for any kind of software, use it to your advantage, and don’t litter it.  </p><p>Keep in mind that logging is for you, you will be reading them whenever you need to debug why the function you wrote failed. Save yourself future trouble, and invest in thoughtful logging in advance.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

      <title>Cohesion in simple terms - Software modularity</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Modularity is a must for good software design. It helps with extensibility, readability, maintainability, and more. It certainly isn’t easy to make your code modular, but what exactly is modularity, and how do we measure it?</p><h2 id="Definition"><a href="#Definition" class="headerlink" title="Definition"></a>Definition</h2><p>Modularity describes a logical grouping of related code, which could be a group of classes or functions. [1]</p><p>Modularity measures how well your code is separated into different modules or chunks of functionality. The more modular your code is, the easier it will be to change. Making your code modular isn’t an end, but a means to an end: you want to make it easier for others (including yourself) to understand what your code does and how it works.</p><h2 id="How-do-we-measure-modularity"><a href="#How-do-we-measure-modularity" class="headerlink" title="How do we measure modularity?"></a>How do we measure modularity?</h2><p>There are more than a few useful metrics to measure modularity.<br>In this series, I’ll do my best to help you understand cohesion, coupling, and connascence.</p><p>This part will focus on cohesion, let’s go.</p><h2 id="Cohesion"><a href="#Cohesion" class="headerlink" title="Cohesion"></a>Cohesion</h2><p>In the book Fundamentals of Software Architecture, Mark Richards and Neal Ford define what is a cohesive module.</p><p>A cohesive module is one where all the parts should be packaged together, because breaking them into smaller pieces would require coupling the parts together via calls between modules to acheive useful results. [1]</p><p>Let’s start with a simple class example</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">C</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    self.a = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">    self.b = <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">do_a</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    func(self.a)</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">do_b</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    func(self.b)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The above class is not cohesive. Why?<br>Since its functionality can be broken into two separate classes without affecting the results.</p><p>In order to make this class cohesive, we can split it into two classes that don’t contain variables that are excessive to some methods (variable a is excessive to method do_b, and variable b is excessive to method do_a).</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">A</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    self.a = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">do_a</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    func(self.a)</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title class_">B</span>:</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">__init</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    self.b = <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">do_b</span>(<span class="params">self</span>):</span><br><span class="line">    func(self.b)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Building on top of this example, we can illustrate this in a graph.<br>Consider a class, all of its methods and variables will be vertices.</p><p>There’s an edge between the method vertex, M1, and the variable vertex, V1 if M1 uses V1.</p><p>For example, consider this scenario where we have 5 methods and 5 variables in a single class.</p><p>Method 1 uses only variable 1<br>Method 2 uses both variable 2 and variable 5<br>Method 3 uses only variable 3<br>Method 4 uses only variable 4<br>Method 5 uses only variable 5  </p><p>From the above scenario, we can generate the following graph</p><p><img src="/../cohesion-images/non-cohesive.png"></p><p>We can deem this class non-cohesive because most methods can be split up into different classes as we did with the first code example. (for example, Method 1 doesn’t use variables 2–5 so there’s no benefit to keeping them under the same class)</p><p>In contrast, a cohesive class would have a graph with far more edges, for example</p><p><img src="/../cohesion-images/cohesive.png"></p><p>More edges mean that each method uses more variables and splitting up is harder&#x2F;less efficient&#x2F;impossible.</p><h2 id="How-do-we-measure-cohesion"><a href="#How-do-we-measure-cohesion" class="headerlink" title="How do we measure cohesion?"></a>How do we measure cohesion?</h2><p>Now that we have a rough idea of what cohesion means, let’s formalize how we measure it.</p><p>Given n methods M1, M2, …, Mn contained in a class C1 which also contains a set of instance variables { Ai }. Then for any method Mi we can define the partitioned set of</p><p>P &#x3D; {(Ai, Aj) | Ai ∩ Aj &#x3D; φ}<br>Q &#x3D; {(Ai, Aj) | Ai ∩ Aj ≠ φ}</p><p>then <strong>LCOM</strong> &#x3D; |P| — |Q|, if |P| &gt; |Q|</p><p>&#x3D;0 otherwise</p><p>LCOM is a count of the number of method pairs whose similarity is zero. [2]</p><p>Let’s break this definition down with both of the graph examples.</p><p>first example:<br>A1 &#x3D; { V1 }<br>A2 &#x3D; { V2, V5 }<br>A3 &#x3D; { V3 }<br>A4 &#x3D; { V4 }<br>A5 &#x3D; { V5 }  </p><p>A5 ∩ A2 &#x3D; { V2}<br>And all other intersection results in empty sets, meaning that:<br>|P| &#x3D; 9, |Q| &#x3D; 1<br>LCOM &#x3D; 8</p><p>second example:<br>A1 &#x3D; { V1, V3, V4 }<br>A2 &#x3D; { V2, V5 }<br>A3 &#x3D; { V2, V3 }<br>A4 &#x3D; { V4, V5 }<br>A5 &#x3D; { V1, V5 }  </p><p>|P| &#x3D; 3, |Q| &#x3D; 7<br>LCOM &#x3D; 0</p><p>LCOM &#x3D; 0 indicates a cohesive class.</p><p>LCOM &gt; 0 indicates that the class needs or can be split into two or more classes, since its variables belong in disjoint sets. [2]</p><p>From the above example, we can understand that the cohesiveness of a class&#x2F;module is a gradient, and not necessarily a yes&#x2F;no question.</p><p>Mostly, in order to effectively use this metric, you set a threshold for cohesiveness — for example, if LCOM &gt; 20 we regard the class as non-cohesive, otherwise the class is cohesive.</p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h2><p>[1] Fundamentals of Software Architecture, by Mark Richards, Neal Ford</p><p>[2] Chidamber, S., R., Kemerer, C., K., A Metrics Suite for Object Oriented Design, IEEE Trans. on Software Eng., Vol.20, №6, June 1994.</p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

The scheduler is picking processes to run from this runqueue based on the policy.</p><h5 id="SCHED-FIFO"><a href="#SCHED-FIFO" class="headerlink" title="SCHED_FIFO"></a>SCHED_FIFO</h5><p>As you might have guessed, in this policy the scheduler will choose a process based on the arrival time (FIFO &#x3D; First In First Out).</p><p>A process with a scheduling policy of SCHED_FIFO can ‘give up’ the CPU under a few circumstances:</p><ul><li>Process is waiting, for example for an IO operation.<br>When the process is back to ‘ready’ state it will go back to the end of the runqueue.</li><li>Process yielded the CPU, with the system call _sched_yield.<br>_The process will immediately go back to the end of the runqueue.</li></ul><h5 id="SCHED-RR"><a href="#SCHED-RR" class="headerlink" title="SCHED_RR"></a>SCHED_RR</h5><p>RR &#x3D; Round Robin<br>In this scheduling policy, every process in the runqueue gets a time slice (quantum) and executes in his turn (based on priority) in a cyclic fashion.</p><p>In order for us to have a better intuition about round robin, let’s consider an example where we have 3 processes in our runqueue, A B C, all of them have the policy of SCHED_RR.<br>As shown in the drawing below, each process gets a time slice and executes in his turn. when all processes ran 1 time, they repeat the same execution order.</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50831652/192136610-96aff4c8-9310-4ad1-a3e8-94858941b78e.png" alt="1_45XO_ysE6pOLZaP31FyrVQ (1)"></p><h4 id="Conventional-Scheduling"><a href="#Conventional-Scheduling" class="headerlink" title="Conventional Scheduling"></a>Conventional Scheduling</h4><p>CFS — Completely Fair Scheduler is the scheduling algorithm of conventional processes since version 2.6.23 of Linux.</p><p>Remember the metrics of schedulers we discussed at the top of this article? so CFS is focusing mainly on one metric — it wants to be fair as much as possible, meaning that he gives every process gets an even time slice of the CPU.<br><strong>Note that</strong>, processes with higher priority might still get bigger time slices.</p><p>In order for us to understand how CFS works, we will have to get familiar with a new term — virtual runtime (vruntime).</p><h5 id="Virtual-Runtime"><a href="#Virtual-Runtime" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Runtime"></a>Virtual Runtime</h5><p>Virtual runtime of a process is the amount of time spent by actually executing, not including any form of waiting.</p><p>As we mentioned, CFS tries to be as fair as possible.<br>To accomplish that, CFS will schedule the process with the minimum virtual time that is ready to run.</p><p>CFS maintains variables holding the maximum and minimum virtual runtime for reasons we will understand soon.</p><div style="page-break-after: always;"></div><h4 id="CFS-—-Completely-Fair-Scheduler"><a href="#CFS-—-Completely-Fair-Scheduler" class="headerlink" title="CFS — Completely Fair Scheduler"></a>CFS — Completely Fair Scheduler</h4><p>Before talking about how the algorithm works, let’s understand what data structure this algorithm is using.</p><p>CFS uses a red-black tree which is a balanced binary search tree — meaning that insertion, deletion, and look-up are performed in O(logN) where N is the number of processes.</p><p>The key in this tree is the <strong>virtual runtime</strong> of a process.</p><p>New processes or process that got back to the ready state from waiting are inserted into the tree with a key vruntime&#x3D;min_vruntime.<br>This is extremely important in order to prevent starvation of older processes in the tree.</p><p>Moving on to the algorithm, at first, the algorithm sets itself a time limit — sched_latency.<br>In this time limit, it will try to execute all ready processes — N.<br>This means that each process will get a time slice of the time limit divided by the number of processes — Qᵢ &#x3D; sched_latency&#x2F;N.</p><p>When a process finishes its time-slice (Qᵢ), the algorithm picks the process with the least virtual runtime in the tree to execute next.</p><p>Let’s address a situation that might be problematic with the way I described the algorithm so far.<br>Assuming that the algorithm picked a time limit of 48ms(milliseconds) and we have 6 processes — in this case, every process gets 8ms to execute in his turn.</p><p>But what happens when the system is overloaded with processes?<br>Let’s say the time limit remains 48ms but now we have 32 processes, now each process has 1.5ms to execute — and this will cause a major slowdown in our system.</p><p><strong>Why? What’s the difference?</strong></p><p>Context switches.<br>A context switch is a process of storing the state of a process or thread so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.</p><p>Every time that a process finishes its execution time and a new process is scheduled, a context switch occurs which also takes time.</p><p>Let’s say that a context switch costs us 1ms, in the first example where we have 6ms per process, we can allow that, we waste 1ms on the context switch and 5ms on actually executing the process. but in the second example, we only have 0.5ms to execute the process — we waste most of our time slice for context switching and that’s why it simply cannot work.</p><p>In order to overcome this situation, we introduce a new variable that will determine how small a time slice is allowed to be — min_granularity.</p><p>Let’s say that min_granularity&#x3D;6ms and get back to our example.<br>Our time limit is 48 and we have 32 processes.<br>By the calculation we made before, every process will get 1.5ms but now it is simply not allowed because the min_granularity specifies the minimum time slice each process should get.</p><p>In this case, where Qᵢ &lt; min_granularity we take min_granularity as our Qᵢ and change the time limit according to it.</p><p>In our example, Qᵢ would be equal to 6ms since 1.5ms &lt; 6ms and that would mean that the new time limit would be Qᵢ ⋅ N &#x3D; 6ms ⋅ 32 &#x3D; 192ms.</p><hr><p>To Summarize, the differences between RR and CFS are as follows</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50831652/192136627-c4d10128-e50f-4ca9-9197-97fe3b2274bf.jpeg" alt="1_a7Ucr9-JgFzaU0VxzOctwA (1)"></p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>What would happen if we will write a new OS from scratch right now? can we do it better? can we improve security and robustness? can we prevent unexpected interactions between applications?</p><blockquote><p>“what would a software platform look like if it was designed from scratch with the primary goal of dependability?” [1]</p></blockquote><p>These are the type of questions that the Microsoft Research team was trying to answer around 18 years ago and it was then when they came up with a pretty cool name for their new OS — Singularity.</p><h1 id="Goals"><a href="#Goals" class="headerlink" title="Goals"></a>Goals</h1><p>Singularity was aimed to eliminate some of the shortcomings of existing operating systems such as</p><ul><li>General security vulnerabilities</li><li>Failures due to extensions, drivers, add-ons.</li><li>Unexpected interactions between apps</li><li>Lack of robustness</li></ul><h1 id="Strategy"><a href="#Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Strategy"></a>Strategy</h1><ul><li>Utilize a safe programming language — no more of C’s shenanigans, we don’t want to “cook” pointers out of integers, no more manually freeing memory and no more buffer overflows.</li><li>Use verification tools — impose constraints that will make verifications easier.</li><li>Improve system architecture and design.</li></ul><h1 id="Singularity-Architecture"><a href="#Singularity-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Singularity Architecture"></a>Singularity Architecture</h1><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50831652/183026569-254cd70a-6c14-45f0-9df8-bd19da5c03b7.jpeg" alt="1_1mnFIlzUc5ym71zpONVkJA"></p><p>Singularity provides 3 main abstractions:</p><ul><li>Software-isolated processes (SIPs)</li><li>Contract-based channels</li><li>Manifest-based programs (MBPs)</li></ul><p>Let’s drill down into each of these.</p><h2 id="Software-isolated-processes"><a href="#Software-isolated-processes" class="headerlink" title="Software-isolated processes"></a>Software-isolated processes</h2><p>A SIP is just like an ordinary process — holding the processing resources, context, and a container of threads.</p><p>The quite surprising part is that all SIPs and the kernel are running in the same address space which also means user code runs with full hardware privileges.</p><p>Isn’t it totally counter-intuitive? we just mentioned that we want to improve security as one of our goals and this change seems to make it worse.</p><p>First, let’s think about why would they even make this change - does it improve anything?</p><p>The answer is yes, it improves performance for example.</p><p>Since all SIPs are in the same address space, context switches are performed faster</p><ul><li>No need to switch page tables</li><li>No need to invalidate and repopulate TLBs</li></ul><p>Moreover, system calls are also faster</p><ul><li>We are always in CPL&#x3D;0</li><li>No need to load the kernel stack</li><li>Instead of sending an interrupt, we can just call a function</li></ul><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50831652/183026863-4d4f7ade-ad00-4ca2-b9d2-99a83fbfa822.jpeg" alt="1_ZULVdo_8NjDhQjr7j0itRQ"></p><p>After we convinced ourselves that with this change performance is better let’s take care of the seeming security problem.</p><p>Each SIP is actually sealed — They can’t be modified from outside.<br>There’s no shared memory between different SIPs, no signals, only explicit IPC.<br>There are also no code modifications from within — no JIT, class loaders, dynamic libraries.</p><p>To ensure that SIPs are actually sealed we employ the following constraints</p><ul><li>A SIP only points to its own data — no pointers to other SIPs</li><li>No pointers into the kernel</li><li>SIP exclusively accesses memory the kernel has given to it</li><li>SIP cannot create new pointers — pointers can be provided from a trusted source such as the kernel.</li></ul><p>With these constraints, although there is a shared address space, there is no sharing of data.</p><h2 id="Contract-based-channels"><a href="#Contract-based-channels" class="headerlink" title="Contract-based channels"></a>Contract-based channels</h2><p>We can think of channels as capabilities.<br>Each SIP can have multiple channels that through them we can create IPC(inter-process communication).<br>For Example, an open file is a channel received from the file server.<br>If a SIP gets this channel it means that it has permission to access it.</p><h2 id="Manifest-based-programs"><a href="#Manifest-based-programs" class="headerlink" title="Manifest-based programs"></a>Manifest-based programs</h2><p>A manifest describes the capabilities, required resources, and dependencies of a SIP.<br>A SIP can’t do anything without a manifest and channels.<br>When installing a manifest we are verifying that it meets all safety requirements, that all of its dependencies are met and it doesn’t create a conflict with a previously installed manifest.<br>For example, a manifest of a driver provides “evidence” to prove that it won’t access the hardware of another driver.</p><hr><p>Microsoft also released the following figure, showcasing Singularity’s performance for raw disk benchmarks compared to other well-known operating systems</p><p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50831652/183029843-8de59f0d-571f-4d78-ac00-523d00c66de0.jpeg" alt="1_5dlq24Glci8FdGeh-DXDwQ (1)"></p><hr><p>Singularity is just one example out of many experimental operating systems.<br>It was last released in November 2008 and since then the project was stopped.</p><p>You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/lastweek/source-singularity">Github</a>.</p><p>For further reading, I can recommend the following:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/tr-2005-135.pdf">Microsoft Overview of the Singularity Project</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/osr2007_rethinkingsoftwarestack.pdf">Rethinking the Software Stack</a></p></li></ul><h1 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h1><p>[1] <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/tr-2005-135.pdf">Microsoft Overview of the Singularity Project</a></p><!-- PROMO BLOCK --><hr><p>🚨 Become a better software engineer. practice building real systems, get code reviews, and mentorship from senior engineers.<br>Get started with <a href="https://404skill.github.io/#/">404skill</a></p><!-- END PROMO BLOCK -->]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>FastAPI is a relatively new and trending Python web framework for building APIs.<br>FastAPI’s tag line includes its benefits over other popular web frameworks such as Flask and Django - “high performance, easy to learn, fast to code”.</p><p><strong>Why FastAPI is faster?</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons FastAPI is faster, is that it utlizies Asyncronous Gateway Interface (ASGI) instead of Web Server Gateway Interface(WSGI).<br>WSGI is a long-standing Python standard for compatibility between web servers, frameworks, and applications, which is in the process of being replaced as the standard to ASGI.<br>In a nuteshell, ASGI can be faster than since WSGI can utilize a set of workers, and every worker can take care of a single request in a sequential manner while ASGI supports concurrency.<br>Read more about the differences between ASGI and WSGI in the <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html">ASGI docs</a></p><p>&lt;$&gt;[note]<strong>Note:</strong> Django started supporting ASGI in version 3.0 (released in December 2019)<br>&lt;$&gt;</p><p>In this guide you will learn hands-on how to create a ready for production API with Python’s FastAPI.<br>You will build a complete API, including a persistent database, while implementing all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</p><p>By the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to create an API with a database from scratch using FastAPI.</p><h2 id="Prerequisites"><a href="#Prerequisites" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2><p>To complete this tutorial, you will need:</p><ul><li>A local development environment for Python 3.6+ (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-for-python-3">Setting up</a>)</li><li>Familiarity with Python (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-python-3">Python 3 guides</a>)</li><li>Familiarity with APIs and HTTP Requests  (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-python-requests-get-requests">API and HTTP guide</a>)</li><li>Familiarity with SQL (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-use-sql">SQL guide</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> user</li></ul><h2 id="Step-1-—-Installing-Dependencies"><a href="#Step-1-—-Installing-Dependencies" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 — Installing Dependencies"></a>Step 1 — Installing Dependencies</h2><p>In this step, you will install the modules that you will utilize later on in the tutorial.

test was to check that the call you implemented worked, and also to show the need of formatting of the output which you will implement in the next function.</p><!--3/1 Note Nice explanation here.-->After getting the results from the database query, you would want to "package" this result in some specific manner, normally in a JSON format, and then return the packaged result with a status code that will convey to the user if the API call was successful or that it encountered a problem during the request, for example when searching for a coral that is not in the database.<p>For the purpose of results packaging, I created a new file <code>api_utils.py</code>.</p><p>All API calls which are GET requests will have to return the user some packaged data. for that reason, I wrote a function called <code>api_reply</code> which gets the packaged result and returns it to the user in the form of a JSON.<br>The raw data is getting packaged in a second function called <code>prepare_result</code>.</p><p>First you will implement, <code>prepare_result</code>.<br>Given a data from the database - which you saw was returned as a list, you will create a dictionary with the column names as keys and the matching data from the list as values.</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span
